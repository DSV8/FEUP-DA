    "transcript": "- Yo, guys. Jonathan here, and welcome to the $1,500 smart room upgrade, where the idea is to hit a certain budget and find not only tech, but other elements where there's design, accessories, furniture, and blend those together to create the best possible room setup. Plus, with each of these episodes, I want to give one of you a chance to make some upgrades yourselves. And if you're down with that, make sure you drop a like down below. Now, whether it's a smart room, smart home, smart apartment, the coolest tech on the plant means nothing if your wifi is bottlenecking you. So kicking off the episode is a Linksys Velop. And huge shoutout to Amazon for sending this out and sponsoring this setup. So the Velop is the super attractive router that blends performance with aesthetic. And if your household is packed full of electronics with people fighting over wifi, this could save your family. Now in this case, since we are in a single room, one of these is gonna work perfectly. But in the instance where you have a larger apartment, or maybe home, you can actually get this in a pack of up to three and spread them out evenly, so you can get the fastest possible wifi across your home. Now the instance where you are using more than one of these, what's awesome is they work in a mesh wifi configuration. What that means, is whether it's one, two, or three, they're gonna perform and function as a singular network. That way you're not worrying about Velop one, Velop two, Velop three, multiple passwords, losing your mind. It's one, and that keeps things simple. Now one of these is gonna give you 2,000 square feet of coverage. That's an easy way to figure out how many of these you would need to cover your room or house. You double that and it's gonna give you 4,000, and if you triple them, you're getting a whopping 6,000 square feet of coverage. Now, design-wise, this thing is surprisingly compact, compared to other options out there. What's cool is, the antenna is actually placed towards the top, which is gonna give you better coverage, and it does a fantastic job at minimizing cables, which is gonna prevent you from having that rats' nest. So overall, it looks great, it performs great, there's a really cool companion app to give you more flexibility and control. And if you're looking for a wifi upgrade, this might be your guy, or girl, depending on how you look at an inanimate object. So next up, this is definitely one of the more outside of the box ideas I've tried to put together. The intent her was a kick back and relax spot. So what I have behind me is a pair of Hektar lamps from IKEA, which definitely have that life-size Pixar action. But what makes the setup unique, is inside the lamps, I threw a Sengled Pulse LED kit, which actually have speakers inside the light bulbs. Now what's awesome is these lights and speakers will actually sync together, and play music back in stereo, which creates this really cool immersive setup. So what I'm gonna do, is actually hop into Spotify, and play some music through these guys. Shout out to Ed Sheeran for dropping some great music. (soulful music) So it is definitely a mind trip hearing light bulbs fire music down at you in stereo, but it's a really cool way to chill out and kind of get lost in your own world. I will say though, if you consider yourelf to be an audiophile or are used to really high-end systems, you're probably not going to like this, But if you're looking for something different, unique, this setup is really cool. So next up is for anyone looking to add some extra pixels in their life. Behind me is the LG43UH6100, which is a 43-inch 4K TV for just about 500 bucks. Now what's awesome is this is using an IPS panel. So you're getting great colors, great viewing angles, and in terms of entry-level price 4K TVs, this is definitely one of the better options out right now. What I particularly like about this though, is LG's Web OS interface, which is one of the simplest ways to navigate through a TV. Some of them out there make you want to smash your face with the remote, but this is simple. There's built-in Netflix, built-in Hulu, built-in YouTube, so you can watch videos like this in crispy 4K, without buying anything externally. The picture quality combined with the colors, the price, and the interface, make this a really enticing upgrade, if you're looking to ditch your potato TV. Now below that is the Amazon basics TV sound bar, which is one of the best inexpensive options to upgrade your sound. While TV speakers are getting better and better, I always personally like to use either a sound bar or a dedicated speakers while watching, because it really enhances the overall experience. So this guy is 31 inches in length and optimized to be used with TVs 42 inches or less. In this case, we are using a 43-inch TV because thug life. So if you're one of those people out there who follows the rules and instructions down to the T, this might not be the setup for you, but you can see, side-by-side, they actually pair really well together. On top of being a sound bar for your TV, there's also built-in Bluetooth, and that's cool, because you can also connect your phone, or your tablet, and stream music from there. So with other very similar sound bars out there, priced upwards of 100 to 200 bucks, this thing, for 70 bucks, is a steal. Now, what I have the TV and sound bar housed on, is the IKEA Gettorp. Not sure if I'm pronouncing that correctly, but this is a really great looking TV stand that is priced around 100 bucks. What I like about this is how it blends both aluminum and glass. It's clean, and kind of just screams classy. So last up is the Amazon Tap. You guys have seen me cover the Echo, the Echo Dot, and this brings you Alexa functionality but in a portable Bluetooth package. Now it's a little different in the sense that you're gonna verbally say out loud the name, I'm not gonna say it to trigger your device. You actually press the microphone button here, (speaker dings) \"Add a giant gummy bear to my cart.\" (speaker dings) \"Okay, I've added giant gummy bear. Visit your cart to check out.\" On top of that beyond the Alexa functionality, this is actually a really solid Bluetooth speaker. (rock music) It's got great sound quality. It gets really loud, and if you haven't yet added a Bluetooth speaker and Alexa into your life, this is a great one-two punch. Now as far as those smart room upgrades for your guys, I'm giving away four $250 Amazon gift cards. And you guys can check out the details on how to win down below. Aside from that, hopefully you enjoyed the video. If you did and you're not subscribed yet, maybe hit that button here, and if you love setup videos, you're going to love this desk setup. This Jonathan, and I will catch you guys later.",
