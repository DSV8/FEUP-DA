    "transcript": "- [James] Android has been with us for about 15 years now. And it runs on around 3 billion devices. Way more than even Windows. So today we're gonna look back, at every version of Android ever. Starting out with 1.0 which came out way back in 2008. An innocent time. It looked a little something like this, with the first mass market Android phone, being the HTC Dream. Featuring 256 megs of storage, an actual physical keyboard, and an incredibly lifelike 320x480 display, that slid away from the main body. You get that satisfying kind of click sound, when you hang up. But unsurprisingly, not everyone wanted an easily breakable sliding screen. So it was good that Android 1.5 Cupcake, released in 2009, introduced support for auto-rotation, as well as an on-screen keyboard. It also allowed for third party widgets. Setting the stage for everyone and their mother, to come out with a weather forecast on your home screen. We got Android 1.6 Donut later in 2009, which gave quality of life improvements, like better scaling for different size phones, as well as text-to-speech support. But 2.0 Eclair came later that same year, and represented a bigger improvement, that introduced multi-touch support, and a large suite of photo editing features, as well as an incessant ad for the OG Motorola Droid. The next year we got Android 2.2 Fro-yo, which allowed you to use your phone as a WI-I hotspot, and also supported Adobe Flash. For as long as that was relevant. And it could even play animated gifs. Yes, I say gifs. Marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of human society. This was followed by 2.3 Gingerbread later in 2010, which provided resolutions up to 1366x768, along with support for NFC signals, and the all important selfie cam. Honeycomb or Android 3.0 graced us with its presence, in 2011, and was actually a tablet only version, that introduced a whole new UI design and support, for browser tabs and multi-core processors. The next version for phones though, was Android 4.0 Icecream Sandwich. That one further refined the user experience, bringing us, swipe to dismiss, as well as face unlock, which some people actually thought, was an unnecessary gimmick. But you know what definitely is not a gimmick? Things that will make your phone less annoying. We'll tell you how the next version did that. After we tell you about our sponsor, FreshBooks.

Try FreshBooks for free for 30 days, no credit card required, by going to freshbooks.com/techquickie to get started. We got Android Jellybean 4.1 in 2012, which crucially allows you, to individually disable notifications from specific apps. So you could finally silence those stupid freemium games. 2013's Kit-kat or Android 4.4, helped with optimizing Android for lower-end devices, as there were plenty of phones out, that didn't run Android all that well. But Android 5.0 Lollipop from 2014 was a bigger deal. As it gave us notification cards, similar to how notifications are handled today. This was part of Google's push, to get their new design language, material design, onto phones, which was supposed to provide visual elements, that were cleaner and more intuitive. 2015's release was Marshmallow 6.0, which gave us support for biometric unlocking, via fingerprint. I can't believe they didn't have it before. And USB-C support, so we no longer had to fight, to insert the cable the right way. 2016's Android 7.0 Nougat didn't have a creamy center, but it did give us a split screen option, for displaying multiple apps, as well as customizable settings icons, in the notification shade. Still with us? We're getting to the more modern area of Android now, with 2017's 8.0 Oreo that brought us picture in picture. I guess the little screen is like the Oreo's filling? Who wrote this? (laughs) Along with wider color gamuts, and even a self repair tool, called rescue party, that could save you from getting stuck in a boot loop. Android 9 Pie from 2018, was the last version to be named, after a tasty dessert, unfortunately, and brought a refresh of material design. Disabled notifications, from apps you habitually dismissed automatically, and introduced notch support, which was something I know all of us were waiting for, with bated breath. 2019's Android 10 is the oldest version, that's still supported at the time we wrote this video, and not only did it make our lives easier, with simple gestures, like swipe to go back, which I actually use instead of the buttons, but it gave us the long requested system wide dark mode, so that we can obliterate our retinas a little more slowly. Android 11 released in 2020, clamped down on privacy, by restricting when apps could fetch your location, and made accessing payment methods and smart home functions, a bit easier by holding down the power button. But 2021's Android 12 gave us another privacy boost, by mandating a green indicator, whenever the camera or microphone is active. Alongside a major redesign called, Material You. And aside from the stupid name, it looks like it'll be with us for quite a while, as a way to distinguish Android, from its major competitor, iOS. So that's every version of Android ever, until, of course, Android 13 comes out, and we'll have to do this whole video all over again, 'cause we're completionists like that. Thanks for watching us.
