    "transcript": "- Hey guys, this is Austin. I recently checked out a $150 smartphone, but what happens when you bring that budget down to $80? Shout out to MetroPCS for sponsoring this video. This is the Alcatel A30 Fierce. Typically for $80, you really shouldn't expect much out of a smartphone, but at least on paper this looks decent. Take a look inside the box, and the first thing we see, is two free months of Amazon Music Unlimited. So there are actually a couple different Amazon tie ins with this phone.. Specifically it actually does have Alexa support, if you guys want the code, it's all yours. So we are definitely well into the budget end of the spectrum here, but it actually doesn't feel too bad in the hand. So yes, it is a little bit on the larger side, with a five and a half inch screen. And yes, it is made out of plastic, but it feels reasonably sturdy, it does have this kind of interesting textured finish. Pop off the back, and the first thing you'll see, is a giant please do not remove this battery under any circumstances warning, but above that, not only do we have a micro sd card slot, but also where we put our sim in. Hardware wise, this has pretty much everything you would expect. So not only do you have a headphone jack, but you also do have a micro usb port, would have been nice to see USBC, but it doesn't really matter at this price point. And you also do have the volume rocker, as well as the slightly textured power button. This guy is rocking a 5.5 inch, 720p IPS display. So just like with the Moto E4 Plus, it's nice to have a big display, and the resolution, even though it's a little bit low, really isn't too bad for a budget device. So it does get reasonably bright, however, a couple areas where you can notice the budget price come through, is with color reproduction, and the actual feel of the display. It just doesn't feel quite as premium, as something higher end with gorilla glass. Hey guys, this is Austin. This is the Moto E4 Plus, and it might just be all the smart phone you'll need. For video, I feel like the bigger display actually is a really nice feature. And while the audio isn't amazing, it's a lot better than a lot of other budget phones, just because it does have a single front firing speaker. It's not stereo, but it definitely does sound a lot better than something coming out the bottom, or the back of a phone. It also does have that support for Amazon Alexa. So if you double tap the power button. Who is Austin Evans? - [Alexa] Austin Evans is a tech reviewer with a self titled YouTube channel. - It also does have a fingerprint sensor, which is especially nice to see on such a budget device. So it works just as you'd expect, put your finger on it, and it will immediately unlock the phone and get you straight into it. Spec wise, it's pretty standard. So we have a quad core mediatek 6738 processor, two gigabytes of ram, as well as 32 gigs of storage, that is expandable with that micro sd card slot. So while it might not be a huge value add, having 32 gigs of storage on an $80 phone is actually kind of nice. It's not like, you know, you can pay $600 for a 16 gig phone somewhere else, or anything. - [Camera Man] This is why we don't get invited. - Inside, it has a 3,000 milliamp power battery. That's about the same size as a lot of flagships, but because of the power seeping internals, this should easily be able to last a day. And of course, since it's running on MetroPCS, you can get up to two lines for $75 a month of unlimited data, without gimmicks like speed caps. So far the A30 seems like a completely decent budget Android phone, but I wanna put it through a few challenges. Asking for a friend. Can it game? You definitely have to keep in mind, that this is a budget smartphone, but let's throw a few games at it, and see what happens. First off, we have Super Mario Run. This is not exactly an incredibly graphically demanding game, and to be fair, it's not the smoothest frame rate I've ever seen, so we are dropping a couple frames here and there. But it's totally playable. Next we've got Mortal Kombat X. Huh, this actually works pretty well. Yeah, it's not gonna go blow away a console or something, but this looks totally fine. Last but not least, we have Real Racing Three. So performance isn't amazing, but again, this is an $80 phone, that's essentially able to run most of the graphically demanding games that are available on Android. Are you able to vlog? So this is what it would be like if I was a vlogger, and it's 110 degrees outside. I would just complain a lot for about five minutes or so, and then maybe move on to something else. Can you livestream? So, my first question is, this is an $80 smartphone, can you guys tell the difference on Instagram live? Not bad, not bad, looks good, looks good for 80 bucks, yeah, I totally think so. Can you take a fast photo as if you see a celebrity? You never know when you find a wild Ken Baledo in the wild. Ready, and boom, got it. Not a very good picture, but I got it fast. (laughing) It's not perfect, if you have a little bit more budget to work with, I really do like the Moto E4 Plus, but for $80 the Alcatel A30 is definitely worth a look. So, what do you guys think about the phone? Let me know in the comments below, and I will catch you in the next one.",
