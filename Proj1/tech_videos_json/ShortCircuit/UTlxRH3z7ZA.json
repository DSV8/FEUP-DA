    "transcript": "- This is a little awkward for me to say but do you wanna go on a date with me? What? No, not that kind of date. A Play Date. It's a handheld console so I don't really know how this is supposed to play out (laughs) because it's unlike anything else that I've ever seen before. It's kind of like this Game-Boy kind of thing except like half of it's chopped off and it's got a little crank on the side. If you buy one of these, you get games for free. Well, okay, they're bundled into the cost of the system which I think is 179 U.S. But you get these games drip fed to you in like \"seasons.\" Plus they have an SDK for developers that is completely free and open to use. It's not the kind of retro console that I'm normally used to. Like, this is a retro-style console but it's kind of a new thing and I kinda dig it. All right, let's-- Oh, the inside of the box even has like a little cutout so that this doesn't get rattled around in shipping. That's actually really cool. A USB cable. It's yellow. Everything is very yellow with this thing. Actually there is a cover that you can get for it that's purple. So it's like a Wario-themed console. (laughs) Thankfully, I don't think it farts at you. Let's get the console itself out. One of the things that people seem to be upset about with the Play Date is that the brightness you see the screen at right now, that's the brightness that it's ever going to get. It's not back lit whatsoever. Let's go ahead and Play Date. Oh wow. There it is. We've got games already so we got Whitewater Wipeout, Casual Birder, settings. - [David] That's my favorite game. - My favorite game. I wanna play settings. Give me settings. Okay, we're already set up to wifi. Thank you, logistics. Replay intro. That's a good feature to have cuz we didn't see the intro, but logistics did. Now I wanna see what logistics saw. Oh, that's cute. So it's teaching me the controls just by doing this. Oh, that's really cute. That's adorable. Wow. The frame rate's really good. You might think this is E-ink or something, but no, this is an LCD and just doing this, it's nice. It's not super smooth, but it's better than you might think for something that's yellow and plastic and not back lit. I'm not even playing any games yet, but that intro like the kind of grin that was on my face the whole time is how I kind of feel like these games are gonna go. Really depends on the quality of the games, I guess. Okay. (beeping noises) I'm not sure what's happening exactly. There's like something that's gonna hit me here. Oh, I should have gone back and sniffed the flower so that it would be, yeah. Yeah. See, this is different, right? Yeah. - [David] Did she just kick you in the balls? (laughing) - So that's this game. I don't know how much more there is to it. It's difficult for me to describe what that game was. As you move forward, the guy moves forward but time is always moving anyway. It's a strange concept. Okay, so this is Pick Pack Pup. I can either use the D-pad like a pleb or I can do this. Okay. Dock the crank or press A to continue. Okay, so let's dock the crank. So I guess this game doesn't use crank after that. Yeah, the speaker is pretty good. Like-- (upbeat music) - [David] Yeah. This song's a bop. - Okay, so this is a line matching game. Oh, I've got like an X-ray camera and I'm going through like the z-depth or actually no, it's the focus. That's another thing that I just I cannot see happening with like a traditional console. Like maybe with the the L and R triggers. I'm not sure what size the battery is in this thing, actually. Let me pull the specs real quick. Nintendo took a lot of flack for the way the Wii was just for not being HD and honestly, yeah it was kinda justified. But the reason the Wii was so successful is because they sidestepped everything else. And this is kind of the same idea I think. I mean it's not gonna take off anywhere nearly as big as the Wii, but I don't know. I think it's charming to say nothing else. Just like our sponsor, MSI. Thanks to MSI for sponsoring today's video. Their new MPG Z790 Edge Motherboard is an excellent fit for your 12th or 13th gen intel core processors. It supports DDR5 memory up to 7,200 megahertz plus PCI express gen five. The enlarged heat sync with heat pipe and additional choke thermal pads are built specifically for high-performance gaming systems. It uses Intel's wifi 6E to ensure a secure and stable network connection without compromising speed. To learn more, click the link below. See how they call the screen a \"very special black and white screen.\" It's not back lit but it is super reflective which seems to be the case. Like the actual screen itself isn't super reflective. It's got like kind of a almost matte finish to it but the backing is reflective which is what causes the contrast to be so high. So the battery is, they don't say, but 14 days of standby clock battery and eight hours of active use which is pretty good. I mean you're gonna get pretty good battery life without a backlight on the LCD. Yeah, there's the CPU 168 megahertz cortex M7. That is pathetic. This screen is 400 by 240, one bit. It doesn't have to crunch too much at all. It has 16 megabytes of RAM and four gigs of flash. I was wrong, it wasn't 16. It's four gigs of flash and honestly that's really all it needs. This is basically the specs that you might find in like a not a 90s, but like an early 2000s handheld game console like a GBA or something. Except, you know the screen is significantly less colorful. - [David] Those original GBAs are pretty dim. - Those original GBAs were just like this. They didn't have a backlight. Oh right, it's got an accelerometer. You could totally do like a fishing game if you really wanted to. That would be a good game, I think. Like obviously it's got enough horsepower to do like scaling and rotation and all that kind of stuff with sprites. Oh yeah, they were behind Untitled Goose Game and Firewatch. It is interesting to see all of the game cards because they're not in color over here. You wouldn't know that the puck was supposed to be orange? Brown? Orange. Like I like how they kind of went with the \"be cutesy\" angle of it. Like it's not super kiddy kind of way. It's cutesy in a very casual kind of way which is what this is all about. Yeah, the developer site. Let's head over there. That's their browser-based editor for Play Date. Aw, I need to sign in. But you can make a play date game in your browser. You can tinker with it. You can do whatever you want with it basically. And that's the best kind of hardware. It's something that you can basically just tinker with and that's great. And especially for, I don't know hobbyists or even kids like, I don't know if this is kind of geared towards kids like the name would suggest that it's a very kiddy device. It's also just tackable and I like that and this control scheme, too, I really like. I didn't think that I would. I thought it would be like a gimmick kind of thing. It's kind of grown on me very quickly. Like it's become very intuitive which makes sense when you think about it because we kind of take it for granted these days to have a D-pad, like buttons here, maybe joysticks but that's after a lot of trial and error. Yeah. Speaking of which, as I'm handling it here like getting ready to take it apart. This is really rigid. I can't even get it to creak really. The only thing I can actually do is like accidentally click buttons. It's really nice. So let's get this back panel off. Get in under here. There we go. Oh wow. That's like basically nothing. So the battery is a FelloTech 760 milliamp hour. I don't really have any complaints whatsoever here. Uh oh. (David laughs) It didn't like that. Uh oh. Oh, there we go. Okay, just gonna put this back together. And no one will ever know we were inside. No one will ever know we were ever inside of this thing. What else is there to say? This is a super, super simple little device. It's not meant to be a powerhouse. It's not meant to be the most amazing game console ever. It's meant to be like gimmicky and and fun. And that's kind of what you get out of this this yellow color scheme here. It's not something you'd normally see in your home. Would I pay $179 for this thing? Maybe not, but maybe I'm not the target audience for this. This has potential and it has the potential to make me want to spend $179 for it. And 24 games right now though is a little bit low. I know there are games you can buy on like h.io, you know you can just side load onto the console with USB. And that's another thing too like you can develop your own games. I don't know, I really like it. I'm just not sure if I would buy it. That's kind of the bottom line for me right now. Maybe if they have like a game store and the price of the hardware was like 99 or something like that then it would probably entice me a lot more. I know this is their first hardware project and this is relatively low volume. That's why they're like taking them in waves. So that is part of the factor for the cost. But I mean at the end of the day, it's your money. Thanks for watching this short circuit. Maybe get subscribed and let us know if there's anything else you want us to take a look at like this. Not necessarily, you know, stuff that's been out for a while or maybe something that has been out for a while. Maybe it's flown under our radar or maybe it's a car.",
