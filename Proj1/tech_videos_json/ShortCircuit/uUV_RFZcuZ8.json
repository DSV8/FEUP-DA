    "transcript": "- Marques Brownlee thinks he can tweet about a USB-C cable that shows you the wattage of whatever thing you're plugged into and think that we're gonna do a shorter circuit on it? Well, we are. 90 watt power adapter here and I'm plugged into my Pixel 3. Seems like it wants to settle at 10 Watts, 13 Watts, oh 9.1. The laptop should make use of it a lot, right? 90 Watts? 44. But what if I use an 18 watt power adapter? 10, 14? It's kinda sketchy that this is an OEM product that's being rebranded by a ton of different companies, but it's kinda useful and it doesn't seem like it'll link your devices explode.",
