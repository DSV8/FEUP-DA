    "description": "The Moto Z3 Play is one of the more predictable smartphone releases of 2018 so far. Motorola returns to a glass-on-glass design, adds a second camera for portrait mode, and includes its customary support for the modular Moto Mod accessories. (There's even a free Moto Mod in the box this year, a 2000mAh battery to augment the installed 3000mAh pack.) But can those upgrades get people to spend $499 on this phone with competition like the OnePlus 6 on the field?

    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - [Michael] Right out the gate, it seems to me that few people are likely to buy the Moto Z3 Play. I mean the design is pretty but forgettable and instead of launching on the biggest carrier in America, like it's forerunners, it's debuting on Sprint and U.S. Cellular. Sure you can snap it up unlocked too but priced the way it is? It's basically going head to head with the OnePlus 6 and that's not a great place to be for anyone. So, what does this phone have going for it? Well, legacy. See, back in 2016 Motorola promised that it's new modular smartphone accessories would work with three generations of Moto Z and this phone is the first of that third generation. From speakers to batteries to game pads, you can pick up any Moto mod from any generation and slap it onto any Moto Z from any generation. That kept promise is actually pretty rare in consumer tech and well it means a lot for those who have invested in this ecosystem. There's other good news in the Moto mod department, but I'll come back to that in a second. First, let's visit the new camera around the back and don't let the dual lenses full you. I think I've said that before. See unlike, say, the Moto X4, this second one is not for something fun like wide angle. It's just a depth center for portrait mode. At the briefing, Motorola had this nice backdrop setup for us to take portrait photos and the city skyline and studio lighting do a nice job of covering up for the inevitable edge detection errors, but they're there just like on every phone ever. I'm obligated to say these were shot with pre-production devices, but honestly I've never been truly satisfied with any phone's portrait mode and I doubt the Moto Z3 Play will change that. I am happy to see the native cinemagraph mode though. See, you can selectively animate portions of a photo while leaving other sections static which makes for some trippy fun that you can share. It's not really new. We were doing this on Window's phones back in 2013, but it's a cool enough feature that I'm really glad it's built right into the camera now. Motorola's good at that on the whole including tweaks people actually find useful and taking the knife to old features that are either unpopular or redundant. So, some old favorites, those physical shortcuts of twist to camera and chop to flashlight and those controls remain. You can still switch out buttons for gestures which Motorola does very well. And Moto display is still the best always on screen I've used on a phone. In more peculiar developments, we now have a fingerprint sensor on the side of the phone, Sony style, and it doesn't double as a power button. Instead, Motorola took everyone's least favorite BlackBerry feature and brought it over here with a power button on the left side of the phone. So, there's that. Let me toss up a spec sheet here so you can see what we're working with. I'm not too worried about the Snapdragon 636 because the last two generations of Moto Z Play were plenty snappy on a 62X and this one's supposed to be 30% faster with more LTE capabilities too. I am a little annoyed they made the phone thicker without making the battery any bigger, but last year's phone had great staying power, so I'm expecting the same here. You should know that the headphone jack is gone and I'm not a big fan of the regression to a glass rear plate, but here's where the good news comes back on that Moto mod front. If you buy the phone unlocked, you'll get a 2000 MiLi power battery mod for free in the box. No rebates, no six to eight weeks before delivery. Right there when you buy it. If you ask me, it's what the company should of been doing from the beginning. Frankly at this point, I'm still doubtful of whether any of that will make people care about this device. At 4.99 unlocked, it's a tough sale when you've got competition like OnePlus for 30 bucks more and Motorola's own G6 giving you three quarters as much for half the price. But let's close things out with a look to the past. Motorola wrapped up our briefing with a little fact toy that I found interesting. Maybe you will too. The Moto Z2 Play, that's last years, has the highest consumer sentiment rating of the entire Motorola portfolio. And it's sold 30% better than the first Moto Z Play did. So, well, even without Verizon Wireless onboard, maybe there's hope for this phone yet. Full review is coming soon, folks.
