    "description": "The OnePlus 5 is the next phone in the family formerly known as “flagship killers.” Like its immediate predecessor the OnePlus 3T, the OnePlus 5 is better described as a \"killer flagship,\" with top-of-the-line specs packed into a very affordable package. That’s OnePlus’s game, after all, and the company plays it well. But does its focus on camera quality justify the slightly higher price tag – and will you be able to tell it apart from your friends’ iPhones?

    "transcript": "- [Michael] The single most important part of today's most buzzworthy Android phone is its camera. To the company that built it, this camera is the standout feature by which its fifth generation phone will be judged, but the bigger picture is the smartphone around that shooter. It's the most expensive phone its creator has ever produced but it's still much more affordable than it should be. I'm Michael Fisher and this is the Mr. Mobile review of the OnePlus 5, brought to you by DBrand. Now, normally, I start with design and end on specs, but today, I'm flipping that around, because at the heart of the OnePlus 5 is much more brawn than you probably need. The very latest silicon, backed up by a big battery with super fast charging and an absurd amount of RAM, realistically, much more than the Android operating system can even use at this point. There's no microSD slot but the two storage options are big and fast enough for 2017, and while the display is almost if not completely identical to last year's panel, it's been optimized. Better color toning, a wider brightness range, and the blue light filter no longer uses that sickly green shade. On top of that, there's now a dedicated reading mode that switches the screen to monochrome and adds sharpness when you open apps like Kindle or News. Personally, I didn't find much utility in reading mode but I like it anyway, because it's proof that OnePlus still sweats the small stuff when it comes to convenience. You can tweak things on the OnePlus 5. Not just the accent and theme colors, but also which icons get displayed up in the status bar, so I can finally get rid of that dorky NFC logo. You can drop the notification shade with either a swipe down on the desktop or a long press on one of the capacitive keys, making the phone easier to use one handed. Those buttons down below and the ceramic fingerprint sensor can support up to two shortcuts a piece, and whether you take the time to do all of that or none of that, the phone responds to your inputs with a liquid fluidity matched only by the likes of the U11 and Google Pixel. As far as software goes, every Android phone should work just like this. On to that critical, crucial camera. With the 5, OnePlus joins the dual camera ranks, its primary shooter flanked by a second sensor made into a so-called telephoto lens. This is much the same configuration used by the iPhone 7 Plus. It means you can zoom in on a subject without cropping the picture, and thus reducing its quality. That can certainly come in handy, and I like that it works in video mode too, but while the second sensor is higher in resolution, it's also got smaller pixels and a smaller aperture, so it's a poor choice for low light. Furthermore, the portrait mode that's meant to selectively blur the background is very finicky, and even when I thought I got it right, there was blurring and bleeding at the edges. On the plus side, there's a pro mode here that's really good. It's got an artificial horizon, a histogram, even though I don't really know how to read that, and manual controls. As usual, I found manual focus to be the most useful for those times auto focus just doesn't cooperate, and in both still and video modes, the primary camera can snap up some lovely images. I'll share more of these on the Mr. Mobile Facebook page and if you're looking for comparisons with other phones, check out Android Central. They've got a lot more on this. On the whole, the camera here is good, and that goes for the selfie shooter up front too, but I wish OnePlus had found a way to include optical stabilization, the absence of which was really evident when filming in 4K, and given the hit or miss quality of portrait mode, I think the only truly useful thing about that second camera is the zoom. So yeah, a definite step up from last year, but not quite a grand slam. I've used the OnePlus 5 for two weeks, and in that time, I've come across a lot of little things I've come to appreciate. The vibration motor is stronger than last year's, making typing much more satisfying, and I'll never get tired of using a simple switch to flick my ringer from loud to silent. The downward firing speaker is loud enough, the headphone jack nice to have, voice calls within expectations, and battery life is fine. The 5 sees me through a full day, about 14 hours of heavy use, by which I mean taking tons of photo and video, which is good, but as for OnePlus's claim of a 20% boost in endurance compared to the last model, no, I'm not really seeing that. I only broke the five hour screen on time mark once, so definitely bring the dash charger along if you expect to be home much past dinner time. Finally, how about that design? While to some folks, it looks very similar to a new phone called the R11 from OnePlus's sister company, Oppo, to others, it looks like an iPhone without the cool water resistant part. This isn't the world's most eye catching design, and that's not great for a company that sells the notion that by buying a OnePlus, you're buying into something unique. Personally, the only comments I've gotten from friends on this phone have been to ask why I switched to an iPhone. To avoid that, you can cover it up. The signature slap-on covers are available in a whole slew of materials, and you can use the scratch you save on the phone to buy them. While it's the most expensive OnePlus yet, the 5 still tops out at a super reasonable $539, and you can get the lower end model, you know, the one with only six gigs of RAM, for $479. If none of the shells ring your bells, you can always hit up DBrand. I asked them to hook me up with the concrete vinyl skin, and 15 minutes later, my OnePlus 5 looked and felt like a chunk of my basement floor, in a good way. Whichever finish you choose, it goes a long way toward scrubbing off the iPhone vibe. If you want one, you know where to find it. Hit the link in the description, and skinned or unskinned, if you buy the OnePlus 5, you'll be getting some of the best specs and software available on Android for about 150 bucks less than the Samsung and HTC competition. That fact alone makes it a standout in its category, no matter how much the design suggests it just wants to blend in. That competition? I've reviewed it. Check it out on the Mr. Mobile YouTube channel and subscribe while you're there, so you don't miss new videos landing at least twice a week. Until next time, thanks for watching, and stay mobile, my friends.",
