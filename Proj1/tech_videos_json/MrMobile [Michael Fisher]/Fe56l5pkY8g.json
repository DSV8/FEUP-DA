    "description": "It’s been a full year since I last gave you a peek into my pockets for a tour of MrMobile’s everyday tech. That’s equivalent to four years on the planet Mercury, seven years to the common canine – and roughly a century when it comes to mobile technology. In that time I’ve traded Windows Mobile for BlackBerry; shed the Microsoft Band in favor of some even bigger smartwatches; and upgraded to the new iPad Pro while leaving my MacBook as-is. You’ve seen me review the stuff; now come see what I prefer to pack. This is MrMobile’s 2017 Everyday Carry!\n\n\n[SPONSOR]\n\nBrought to you by dbrand.

    "transcript": "- It's been a full year since I last gave you a peak into my pockets for a tour of my everyday tech. That's equivalent to four years on the planet Mercury, seven years to the common canine, and roughly a century when it comes to mobile technology. In that time, I've traded a dead smartphone platform for a zombie one, shed one wearable and beefed up another, and I've upped my tablet game, at the expense of my laptop one. This is MrMobile's 2017 Everyday Carry. Brought to you by dbrand. (electronic music) I've always said, you shouldn't base your own buying decisions on what we tech bloggers and YouTubers carry and to see why, you don't need to look any further than my daily driver. Not that the BlackBerry KEYone is a bad phone by any means, it's just that I carry it for all the wrong reasons. Namely, a desire to stand out from the masses and a pretty unhealthy obsession with the past. See, my very first smart phone was a Blackberry, so every time I lay my thumbs down on these keys, part of me is instantly back in 2005, tapping out LiveJournal entries at the laundromat. Yeah, it's silly and sentimental, but judging by how many KEYones I've seen in the hands of friends and press events, I'm hardly alone in that. Another habit from the lifestyles of the uber nerdy, dual wielding smartphones. When my second pocket isn't full up with whatever phone I'm reviewing, I carry the LG G6. Why? Because almost every time I take a picture with any other smartphone, I wish I'd taken it with the G6's wide-angle camera. You know those things I do sometimes, where I drop in little inserts that were taken outside the studio? Well, more often than not, they're shot with the G6, latched onto this little Huawei Tripod or my DJI Gimbal. It's not the perfect camera, it's got some color issues and that lens cover is already beat all to hell. But, when you can come away with shots like this, it's easier to look past that stuff. Not since the Lumia 1020 of four years ago, have I had some much fun taking pictures on a phone. Oh and, speaking of Windows Mobile, like most folks, I had to ditch it, along with the Microsoft Band that I never really liked much anyway. So, I've traded in my two tan lines for one. But, I make the left side count by hopping between two smartwatches. Both of them running Android Wear 2.0 and both of them comically huge on my skinny wrists. I've talked about these a bunch in other videos, so I won't dwell on them here, basically I strap on the LG Watch Sport on ordinary days and the Casio PRO TREK F20 when I'm on the boat or leading an away mission into the wilderness. I'm still waiting for a smartwatch to come along and really capture my heart, like the Pebble did. But until then, these do the trick. Half the video done and no mention of Apple? Well, consider this, every single MrMobile video you've ever seen has been edited on this machine. The same 2015 MacBook Pro I showed you last summer. Now, people sometimes ask me why I haven't upgraded to the newer models yet. And, well that SD card slot Apple eliminated on the newer ones, I use it every day. I use those USB Type A ports every day, and that Magsafe cable Apple also phased out, it saves this machine from utter destruction at least once a month. So, yeah I'm one of the pros Apple alienated with those new machines and I'm just not ready to introduce all the inconvenience of added accessories into my life, when this machine just works fine. If it weren't for my dependence on Final Cut Pro to edit videos, I probably would have switched to a Windows box by now. I still like keeping up with what's new in Windows 10, so when I don't have to edit video, I carry the Surface Book with Performance Base. A review unit Microsoft was good enough to let me hold onto for a while. But, that's a big ol' beast of a machine, who's power I don't often need, even in tablet only mode. So, when it's time to lighten the load a little, I hop on over to my lone IOS device, the new iPad Pro 10.5 with Apple Keyboard. Yes, the 120 Hz display is as slick as you've heard, but my time with the Surface has gotten me used to a more cutting edge hardware aesthetic. I couldn't help being a bit bored with the iPad's design. And it was already starting to pick up some scrapes from clumsy yours truly. So, I asked my friends from dbrand to swing by to spruce it up with a vinyl skin and as you've seen on my other devices, they do a lot more than just iPads. Check the link in the description if you want to dbrand your device or just make it stand out from the crowd. If you're more interested in quieting down the crowd, the BOSE QC35's are still my daily go-to. They're the first headphones I ever used with acoustic noise canceling. My gateway drug to a world of silence some consider unnatural. Maybe that's part of the reason they've stayed on my ears even though I've reviewed better headphones since then. I mean, the Sony MDR-1000X have more advanced features and a stronger Bluetooth connection. If I had to do it over again, I'd buy those instead I think. But, the QC35's are still the ones around my neck everyday. Never underestimate the power of habit. Alright, let's bring it home with the pocketables. I keep my cards organized with a simple wallet from Herschel Supply that I bought for not very much money at Newbury Comics and I keep my keys from jingling with a fun little fob called KeySmart. Which I'd like better if the screws didn't constantly loosen themselves up. Still, I like it enough that I'll probably buy the Pro version with built in Tile Tracker when it comes out, thanks to Modern Dad for the heads up there. Yes, I still tap my way into the T, Boston's subway with the Sesame Ring by Ring Theory. And of course, all the stuff I covered in this video is way too much to fit into even Scotty vest-sized pockets, so my bag of choice these days, is the TYLT Energi Pro, which blends style, storage, and extra endurance into a pretty comfy backpack. That bag, along with almost everything else in this video has gotten my full review treatment at some time or another, folks. So, if you wanna learn more about any of this stuff, check out the MrMobile on YouTube.

One more shout out to dbrand for making this peak behind the scenes possible. Until next time everyone. Thanks for watching. And stay mobile my friends.",
