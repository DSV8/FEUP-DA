    "transcript": "How much better is the Raspberry Pi 5 than a Raspberry Pi 4? In this example I've got the Raspberry Pi 5 connected to this computer using OBS Rising Pi 4 is connected to that one I'm going to use hashcat the baseline option to test how good both of them are and what I'll do here is I'll press enter at the same time we can see the first option is to check MD5 we've already got the result on the Raspberry Pi 5 77000 kilohashes per second. On the Raspberry Pi 4 34000 kilohashes per second SHA1 we've already got a result on the Raspberry Pi 5 57000 kilohashes per second 26000 on the Raspberry Pi 4. 256 we've got 127 on the Raspberry Pi 4 256 is already office screen on the Raspberry Pi 5. it's going through this a lot quicker but here we've got 24000 we can see that the 5 is much better we're looking at a speed increase of two to four times and I'm seeing that in this basic test.",
