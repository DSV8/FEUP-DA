    "transcript": "In this video I'm going to show you how to get Kali Linux installed on an Android phone. This is a pixel 7 Pro running Android 14, this is a Samsung phone running Android 13 both of them have Kali Linux installed as a rootless installation process is exactly the same. So as an example on this phone you can see that it's running Android 13 and on this phone the pixel phone you can see that it's updated to Android 14. I'm also going to show you how to solve problems that a lot of people have had people have had issues with phantom process is killing the GUI on a phone. So I'm going to show you how to solve that so that you can run KeX or the GUI version of Kali without any problems. My team and I have created a PDF which I've linked below that shows you this issue and then also shows you the full installation so you can follow along with this video or download the below PDF and use that to help you get Kali installed. This is the easiest installation of Kali Linux on an Android phone if you do a rooted installation it's a lot more difficult and I've covered that in separate videos which I'll link below. Okay but without further ado let me show you how to get Kali Linux installed as a rootless installation on an Android 14 phone so as mentioned here we've got an Android 14 phone. This is a pixel 7 Pro. First thing we need to do is install Termux you can get that from the F-Droid store or you can go to GitHub in this example I'm going to use GitHub please note that on the official Termux Wiki as well as the Termux GitHub pages we're told that we shouldn't install the outdated version of Termux hosted on the Google Play Store as always you install software like this at your own risk you have to decide if you want to install this or not I'm going to install the software from GitHub on this pixel phone but as always you need to make that decision for yourself. So I'm going to open up Google Chrome and go to GitHub the link is github.com/termux/termux-app/releases once again use the PDF below if you want to follow all of these instructions gives you a lot of information. What are we going to do is download the APK file I'm going to click download anyway exactlyper the instructions in the PDF. I'm going to go to my downloads I'm going to select the Termux Application go to Settings allow from the source and click install, we're now installing Termux which again is required for the installation. I'm going to allow it to send me notifications and there you go we've got that installed. We now need to run PKG update -y or hyphen y so I've typed the command and I'm going to press enter. Now when prompted press y so that you can install the package maintainers version so press y enter, press y again and just repeat that for the installation press y enter, y again and just do that multiple times as needed. Okay so once that's done we need to run the Termux setup storage command you need to do this in order to have shared storage so you need to give Termux storage access permission this doesn't give it access to external connected devices however so command is termux - setup - storage I'm going to allow it to have access to various folders and once that's done we need to install wget. Now again a lot of people have had problems trying to install Kali as a rootless installation on their phones so we're covering a whole bunch of options here to make sure that you can get it working. So we need to install wget so command pkg install wget press y when prompted okay so wget is installed and now using wget we can download NetHunter and install it. So the command is wget -0 install -nethunter -termux and then the link to offsec website so press enter and notice the software has been downloaded and now we need to change permissions. So char mode or chmode +x install -nethunter -termux press enter and finally now we can install NetHunter Termux and press enter. So we've got various options here I'm going to choose one full installation and press enter. Now this is going to take a while so I'll speed up the video at this point but for you now is a good time to go and get a coffee or something while the installation takes place it's going to take a while if you're asked to delete root FS say no, we don't want to delete root FS but that'll come up after a while so I'll pause the video at this point and speed it up. Okay there you go it took it a while but now we're asked delete downloaded root FS file answer is going to be no so uppercase N press enter and there you go we can now start NetHunter either through the CLI or we can use KeX to get a GUI so commands would be NetHunter to start CLI a shorter option would be NH so just type NH to start NetHunter, you can also use nethunter -r to use root privileges or nh -r to use root privileges. You can set a KeX password by using the command nethunter kex passwrd you can start kex by using the command nethunter kex and then you can stop it by using the command nethunter kex stop. Okay but now now let's try and solve this problem that a lot of people have had when installing NetHunter they get this debus error. So the first thing we're going to do is start NetHunter with root privileges so nh -r and as you can see there we've got NetHunter running but we're running as root we're going to use nano I mean you could use VI if you really wanted to but we'll use Nano to keep it simple to edit the etc resolve.conf file. So nano /etc /resolv.conf what we're going to do here is change the DNS server information again this is a problem that a lot of people have had at the moment the DNS is showing as 127.0.0.53 change that to for instance Google or another DNS server. So I've now changed the name server to Google 8.8.8.8 what we're going to do is press crl X to exit and Y to save the file and enter to overwrite the file. So what we can do now to verify that is use cat and as you can see there once again the name server is set to Google. So what we're going to do now is update our references so apt update so there you go references are being updated and again to solve the problem we're going to install the software so debus -x11 and press enter and there you go the debus software is being installed. Okay one of the problems a lot of people have had is that child processes are killed so Kali will run for a while and then it'll just be killed so the GUI will crash as an example and that's because child processes are being killed so now we need to stop that. So what I'll do is go to settings scroll down go to about phone scroll down and I'll press build number seven times so that we can go into developer options so that we can become a developer I'll put in my password and notice we are now a developer on this phone I'll go back and then press system, go to developer options, right near the bottom we're going to disable child process restrictions. Okay so there we go now we want to install the App Store and get KeX running on this phone okay so we can go back to NetHunter I'll exit out of there and we're going to run NetHunter KeX to get a GUI running we need to put a password in so specify a password I'll just use a simple password and press enter I'm not going to set a view only password. Okay this is really important make a note of the port number 5901 that's the port number that we're going to connect the GUI to. Okay so the next thing we need to do is go to the App Store so store.nethunter.com/en/ and we're going to select download Store app, download anyway, I'm going to go to my downloads open up that file install it with the package manager I'm going to say always install the software and select open we're told that the App Store is based on a previous version of Android that's okay so I'm going to press okay there I'm going to click on the magnifying glass allow it to send notifications I'm going to search for NetHunter KeX and this is the software that we want VNC for NetHunter KeX it's now being downloaded click install, I'm going to go to settings I'm going to allow this press install, go back, press open on my desktop now notice I've got NetHunter here I'm going to say okay allow it to send notifications and now I can specify my username which is kali specify my password I can now specify my port number 5901 and hopefully I'll be able to connect and there you go notice I've now got Kali NetHunter GUI running on an Android phone. This is a rootless installation once again I didn't remove Android so here I can select disconnect to disconnect my session notice I'm back in an Android phone I'll open this up again press connect and there you go I'm now in Kali and I could run applications directly within the GUI or I could just do it through the CLI if I preferred. If you want more information have a look at the PDF which I've linked below have a look at my website have a look at the NetHunter website the documentation and also the link on GitHub with issues with Android 12 that can help you but hopefully this video and the attached PDF has helped you get Kali running on your Android phone as always I'm David Bombal and I want to wish you all the very best.
