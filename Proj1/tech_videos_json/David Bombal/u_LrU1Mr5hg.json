    "transcript": "- Okay, so this is the last day of the David Bombal Christmas giveaway. And to make it more exciting, let's start off with a big prize. One person is going to win a $500 Amazon eGift as a thanks from me to you. Thanks so much for the support this year. So I'll personally be buying this, and sending you an Amazon eGift. Really want to thank you for your support, want to thank you for purchasing my courses on Udemy, GNS3 Academy, and davidbombal.com. Without you, none of this would be possible, so I really want to thank you for watching my videos on YouTube and purchasing my courses. So one person will receive a Amazon eGift with the value of $500. Okay, quick update. I've got some good news. Cisco are going to sponsor one person to take their CCNA exam, so if you're planning on getting your CCNA in 2020, this is your opportunity to take the exam for free. So one person will be able to take their CCNA exam for free thanks to the sponsorship of Cisco. So use the link below if you're planning to take your CCNA exam in 2020. You could be the lucky winner of a free coupon to take your CCNA exam in 2020. I want to tell you about a new CCNA study group that Cisco have created. Cisco study groups have been around for many years, they are a fantastic place to share information with others, but also learn from people who have been in the industry for a long time. If you're studying for your CCNA exam and you're struggling with a topic or some concept, there are other people in the Cisco study groups that can help you. So use this link or the link below this video to join the brand new Cisco CCNA study group, which helps you pass the CCNA 2020 exam. Great place to share information and learn from others in the industry. Now to continue the giveaways, one person is going to win access to an ebook from Cisco. This is the official cert guide for the CCNP and ENCOR exam. So if you're studying for your CCNP or your CCIE, then this is the book that you want to get. It's an ebook official cert guide from Cisco for the ENCOR CCNP exam, which you also need for the CCIE written exam, so that's changed now. So the CCIE written situation has changed. If you're studying for your CCIE exam, you're gonna want to get the ENCOR OCG book. But again, Boson have really come to the table and supported me in this Christmas giveaway. One person will win access to a CCNA ExSim exam simulation. Two people will win access to a network simulator, so the Boson CCNA network simulator valued at $179, and one person will win access to the Boson CEH exam simulator. So use the software to pass the CEH exam or CCNA exam. So I'm in a different part of South Africa at the moment, it's really hot here so forgive me if I'm a bit slow. Very, very hot and humid at the moment. Now, here's a great giveaway. Kevin Wallace has recently launched his live training for the new CCNA 2020 exam. This is a fantastic giveaway valued at $400. This giveaway includes 16 hours of live training. You'll be trained by Kevin Wallace, who's a double CCIE, a Cisco press author, he's written a lot of books for Cisco. Obviously knows what he's talking about, really well-known in the Cisco community. I'm joining forces with Kevin on this. He's gonna be giving away one seat on his Cisco CCNA live training. Once again, 16 hours of live training by Kevin, who's a CCIE instructor. There's downloadable replays of the live sessions, you get course slides, he has office hours where you can contact him. He's limiting this course to 100 students so that he can interact properly with every student on the course. There's a learner community, there are packet tracer labs, and as a bonus, you also get his CCNA Foundations course, valued at $197. So if you're studying for your CCNA, and you want to be mentored or helped through your studies, this is a fantastic giveaway. I really want to thank Kevin. He's sponsoring this giveaway so that one person can join his new Cisco CCNA live training. In addition, if you use the link below this video, you can join Kevin's master class with a 20% discount. So if you use the link below, and the code that I've added below the video, you'll get a 20% discount to Kevin's master class. You'll get a live training from Kevin valued at $400, but in addition, you'll get a 20% discount. Now, to sweeten this, because this is an affiliate link, I've joined forces with Kevin on this master class. If you use my link below this video, you'll get a 20% discount, but in addition, I'll give you three months of free access to davidbombal.com, where you can access all the courses on davidbombal.com. So you'll get access to Kevin's live training valued at $400, 20% discount, but also access to all the content on davidbombal.com for three months. So I want to make sure that you get the best possible value, so you'll get access to live training from Kevin, fantastic training, but you'll also get access to my content, my video courses, on davidbombal.com for three months. Okay, but another giveaway. Kevin Wallace is sponsoring one person to get access to his CCNP ENCOR video training. This is currently in development, but will be completed by the end of February. However, the winner will get early access to Kevin's training. So if you're studying for the new CCNP and want access to ENCOR training, this is a great giveaway from Kevin. I really want to thank you for your support this year and I want to wish you all the very best in 2020. But hold on, before we finish, 70 people that use this link will get free access to my CCNA packet tracer labs course. First 70 people once again that click on that link get free access to my CCNA packet tracer labs course. And just to make it fair, 70 people that use this link will get free access to my Python for network engineers course. These courses will help you for either your CCNA to learn the basics of networking, or help you learn Python for network automation and network programmability. I want to wish you a fantastic Christmas and a wonderful 2020. All the very best.",
