    "transcript": "- You know, every day is a new opportunity, it's a new opportunity to start afresh, every day is a new beginning. So don't focus on the things of the past, don't focus on the failures of the past. Look to the future and see what you can do today to help you reach your goals. (upbeat techno music) Now if you're enjoying these give-aways, please comment below this video and let me know what you think. Okay, so in today's give-away, one person is gonna win access to the Bosun ExSim-Max Exam Simulation software, for the CEH exam. So if you're studying for the CEH exam, this software will help you pass that exam. One person will win access to the CCNA ExSim software, and two people will win access to the Bosun NetSim Network Simulator software. I'm giving away a lot of CCNA content, because the CCNA changes in about, less than two months. So if you want to pass your CCNA before the cut-over date, use this software to pass your exam and get to your CCNA, so that you can work on your CCNP or other certifications in 2020. Okay, some good news, I've got a CCNP give-away. Cisco have sponsored one copy of the CCNP ENCOR Official Cert Guide. So if you study for the new CCNP exam, this is the book that you want to get. Written by Jason Gooley and others, Jason is a fantastic guy, I've spoken to Jason multiple times, like here in Barcelona, as well as here with NetworkChuck. So if you're interested in getting your CCNP certification, I'd strongly suggest that you get the CCNP ENCOR Official Cert Guide, written by Jason Gooley, and others. Now you can use the link below to enter to win a copy of this book. You could also use the link below if you want to purchase the Cisco priced book at a discount. So if you're studying for your CCNP exam, this is a fantastic resource, great book to read for the CCNP ENCOR exam. (upbeat music) I'm giving away a $100 Amazon eGift. So one person will win a $100 eGift from Amazon, as a thanks from me to you, to say thank you for your support this year. Thank you for watching my videos, thank you for supporting me by buying my courses on Udemy, GNS3 Academy, or on davidbombal.com. I really want to say thank you for a fantastic year, and I really appreciate your support. With that being said, I want to wish you all the very best in 2020. But hold on a minute, before we end off, the first 50 people that use this link will get access to my Wireshark course. I show you practically how to use Wireshark to capture packets off the wire, how to look at protocols such as OSPF, BGP, VTP, DTP and many other protocols. So if you're interested, use this link once again, to get access to my Wireshark course. Really geared towards network engineers, or people that work with networks, and want to understand how to use Wireshark. I'll also show you a whole bunch of tricks that you can use within Wireshark to make your packet captures easier to read. So from a very beautiful and sunny South Africa, I want to wish you all the very best in 2020. (upbeat techno music)",
