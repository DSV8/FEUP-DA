    "transcript": "- Well today is day three of the David Bombal Christmas Giveaway. Are you ready to win some prizes? (upbeat music) Now today I'm giving away a whole bunch of CCNA content. First giveaway is the CCNA Cyber Ops ExSim Exam Simulation software from Boson. When CISCO first announced the changes to CCNA, they said that there's only gonna be one CCNA but they actually changed that. The CCNA Cyber Ops Certification will remain. So if you're studying for the CCNA Cyber Ops Exams, that's not going to disappear. CISCO are keeping that along with the so-called only CCNA Certification. So we no longer have routing and switching, wireless, voice, other types of CCNAs but there is the CCNA Cyber Ops Exam so this software will help you prepare for that exam. Use the link below this video if you wanna enter to win a copy of the Boson ExSim Exam Simulation software for the CCNA Cyber Ops Exam. Now early in this year, I spoke about this book \"Atomic Habits.\" It's a really good book. I suggest that you buy it and you read it if you haven't already. One of the principles in this book is that small changes in your life can have a profound impact on you. If you just adjust your direction slightly, the change is big over a period of time. As an example, an airplane, if it changed direction by just a few degrees, will end up in a totally different place over a thousand miles so by making small changes in your life, you can change your life dramatically. (upbeat music) In addition to the Boson software, I'm also giving away a $100 Amazon e-gift. Use this to buy something for yourself or for someone else. So one person will win a $100 e-gift from Amazon as a thanks from me to you to say thank you for your support this year. But don't worry, I'm also giving away one copy of the Boson ExSim software for the CCNA exam as well as two copies of the Boson NetSim software. So if you're preparing for your CCNA exam, you have the opportunity to win one of two NetSim Network Simulation from Boson as well as one copy of the Boson CCNA ExSim Exam Simulation software. I really want to thank Boson for their support. They've really supported me through this giveaway. They've given me a lot of product to be able to give to you. So please join me in thanking Boson for really supporting this giveaway. Are you enjoying the David Bombal Christmas Giveaway? Please comment below this video and let me know if you're enjoying these giveaways and these prizes. Now I've said you have to be quick and here we go again. The first 30 people that use this link will get free access to my CCNA Packet Tracer Labs course. This course is a practical labs course that helps you pass the CCNA exam. So first 30 people that use that link will get free access to the course. Now go and make a success of 2020. Don't listen to the naysayers. Don't listen to those people who tell you that you can't do it. Go and make a success of your life. Ignore the haters, ignore the doubters. Go and make a success of what you want to do.
