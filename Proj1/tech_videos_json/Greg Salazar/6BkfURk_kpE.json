    "transcript": "- (laughing) Yeah, good old Facebook Marketplace. Gaming beast PC 300 million dollars and of course you'll only find this in Detroit, Michigan. PC is technically brand new. It started a fire once or twice. No issues other than that. Keep your children at least a hundred feet away from the computer when it's turned off. Two miles when on. Have a fire extinguisher available at all times. A radiation suit would be useful. If possible, a paramedic team on standby. Other than that, it is safe. Every now and then the nuclear reactor inside might need changing every one to two minutes. First picture is marketing only, use at the risk of others And what a beautiful hack job this is. So look, all jokes aside, this isn't really what I want to talk about in this video. I just wanted to get your feet wet. This is the kinda stuff you find sometimes on Facebook marketplace. This clearly is just satirical, but there are actual listings out there from folks who, just think they're living in the past. Prices for graphics cards specifically have corrected massively over the past 6-12 months, but there are those out there who insist on living in 2020 and 2021. Specifically, a lot of these folks are ex miners or maybe they're still mining they're just not using graphics cards anymore because they really can't. The cryptos they were mining either plummeted in value or the way in which you mine them completely changed. So graphics cards are pretty much obsolete. Now they're stuck with inventory they don't need anymore. The problem is the market's totally corrected, so they're limited in terms of how much they can actually recoup from their initial investment. That is where they're hoping folks hop onto Facebook marketplace and have no idea what they're doing. Maybe offer to buy all of 'em at your asking price and there you go. They got you off scot free. But we know better. Us PC enthusiasts, we know we can do like five seconds worth of due diligence on eBay or elsewhere and figure out the graphic square prices are a lot lower than these ads are making them seem. Are you ready? These are, these are pretty interesting. Stay with me. NZHT-H7 series cases offer plenty of hardware support and a clean aesthetic sure to compliment any build. Choose between white or black variants as well as standard flow or elite trims for the right mixture of airflow and beauty. There's plenty of room up top for a fan rad combo larger than just a single 120 or 140 and support for up to a 360 mil up front exists for beefy cooling wherever it's needed. You'll also find several fans included depending on the model. If you choose a white one, you'll get white fans. So that's nice. NZXT cases are overall, great values, as you'll find and you can learn more about them by clicking the link below. So let's jump right into the first ad, shall we? This one's, it's a bit of a doozy. \"Mixed card mining rig\" is the title $5,000 asking price. This is listed just over a week ago as a time of filming. It says used for a couple months. Everything basically brand new. Yeah, somehow I doubt that. It's got an Asus B250 Mining Expert in here. Frankly a CPU that's way overkill for what he probably needs. 16 gigs of system ram and this plethora of GPUs that are quite old. Now there's nothing wrong with these cards. I mean if you get them for the right price save maybe the R9s because these run a bit hot, everything else here is perfectly viable. Again, given a decent price and you can get them for decent prices now in late 2022. The issue is he's asking $5,000 for all of this and I find this had to be a bit disingenuous because he says that everything is basically brand new when that is literally impossible because all of these cards were released at least 2-3 years ago and the R9 390s and the RX 580, I mean, these cards are several, several generations old. Same with the 1060 and the 1070 here. So how is that? How is this even possible? I'm gonna do some quick eBay math here just just so you guys know what we're working with. So 2060, I'm gonna ballpark it, let's say $300. That's a lot more than I think you could get 'em for now in eBay, I think you can get 'em for just over $200 which is a pretty good price. But he's only got one of those. So 300 plus for 1660, let's say 150 bucks, plus another 150 for the 1070 and then we've got 4 1060s, it should be around $100. So we're gonna add $400 to that. And then two 580s, we're just gonna say 100 bucks a piece but you can get them cheaper, depends on if they're 4 or 8-gig models and if they're specifically mining variance or not. So let's just say plus 200 and then an R9390, you shouldn't be paying more than 100 bucks for an R9390X. So plus 100, plus we'll make it 200, 100 each for the 390s, that's still, again, we're giving them a huge benefit of the doubt because those prices were pretty high. But still, in our worst case scenario let's say you overpay for each of these cards individually on eBay, you're looking at $1,500 all in for the cards. 16 gigs of RAM is like 50 bucks, i7-7700k maybe $100-150 at the worst. A B250 mining expert, 100 bucks, the power supply to run all this stuff, even though it's not listed, I'm assuming you're gonna get a power supply, a few 100 dollars, I mean two grand, maybe. And this person wants $5,000. So you, you see where this is going, right? Let's move on to the next listing. This here is titled \"Crypto Mining Rig.\" It was originally listed for $5,500 and brought down to four grand. Whoo, ain't that a dose of reality? A $1,500 price cut, that's like 20% off right then and there and well the first picture looks pretty good. In fact all these pictures are decent. I mean you just got like nice lighting and whatnot. It looks like it was professionally built. This is a nice mining setup. I, again, I'm not super familiar with mining but this looks very clean. You can see the motherboard back there the beefy power supply to run all these cards. So it looks like it was better taken care of than the previous listing. The issue is it's still obviously massively overpriced in my view. So you're gonna get five graphics cards here 3070 Tis and he's got them listed at a $1000 each times five, for five grand invested at time of build three months ago, have a whole year for the warranties, have the boxes and all not to mention the warranty information. He's got got two 1200 watt power supplies he says are worth 365 each. Of course this is all technically used by this point. He's got for some reason, again another Core i7 9th gen chip, I'm not sure why. And then you know the frame's a hundred bucks. The keyboard and mouse. I don't know about all this stuff but the real bulk of the deal is obviously in the cards and he says, he makes a few claims here that are just really weird. So first off, he built it for a client. They didn't have the money, said he built it a few months back, he doesn't mine with it. Everything is in pristine condition. Have all the boxes for all the hardware ready to go. And then he says that these are brand new cards, but again they can't be brand new. They can't technically be in perfect condition because you did say that you mined with them. He says this rig was originally built for somebody. \"I don't use it to mine currently,\" he sold one card so he only has five for this rig \"but they're in excellent condition. I have all the boxes\", three months old \"this miner never seen temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius. Very efficient, ready to mine.\" But then he says right above it, \"I only mined with it for one month and received a total of .22 ETH with five cards.\" So these aren't new. They can't technically be new because you did mine with them and you're just hoping that we take your word that you only mined with 'em for one month and not one year. You, you never really know. And I love this part. \"The reason I am selling it a little cheaper is because the graphics cards have dropped a little bit.\" Dropped by like 50%? I mean if you think 50%'s a little bit, fine but that's literally how far down some of these prices have come in six months. Now you can find 3070s and 3070Ti all day for under $400 used. If you multiply 400 times five, that's two grand in cards. Again, that's less than, well that's about half I guess I should say, that's about half the price he's asking. Power supplies, yes, those are worth something. The mining frame, I, but who's really mining it? I mean that's what I really wanna know I guess at this point is who's actually mining anymore? Like the cryptocurrencies across the board have pretty much plummeted in value. There is occasionally a bit of resurgence and then it always ends up correcting. But is, is anyone actually wanting to mine? And if you are, is this sort of mining rig something you're interested in? Anyway, moving on. Here's another older rig, three GPU mining rigs. So three individual ones, you see he's got a nice little stack here with 17 GPUs, whoo whee. Six R9 390xs, five R9 390s and six RX580s and he wants $4,200. Now this one's apparently having a few problems selling because it was listed 22 weeks ago in Delaware, Ohio. That's pretty far out my friend, I think something is very wrong with your listing. Let's see, I have a good feeling it's something to do with the price. So he is got all the cables, PSUs, motherboards, SSDs, he'll wipe drives for delivery. Hive OS is free and easy to install. All GPUs should be in working order. There are a couple that need a fan rep - Okay, so (laughs) I'd wager there's more than a couple if you're willing to disclose that. There's probably some pretty big issues with some of these cards. You ran these machines for about a year. They've just been sitting collecting dust about a year. I don't know, these are pretty old cards. Unless you bought them all used within the last 12 months. I don't know. You maybe could have mined with these for several years cuz these are all several year old SKUs. Even if you don't plan on mining, you could make money just parting these out. I just want to free up the space in my apartment. Well, if you could make money parting these out, why are you not doing that? That's what I, I mean and what are you doing me a favor? He's running a charity folks, that's what it is. He's doing it for the good of mankind. So let's go ahead and whip out the trusty TI84 eBay calculator here. I'm just gonna do some quick math. 17 GPUs, six of those are R9 390Xs. Again, you shouldn't be paying more than a $100 each for those. So we're gonna round that up to $600 plus five R9 390s. Again, another $100 a piece, at the worst I would say. So plus 500 and then six 580s, again, we don't know if they're 4 or 8-gig models, if they're 8-gig models they're little more expensive but still shouldn't be more than $100 a piece at this point. So plus 600 for those that give us a grand total of $1,700, I wouldn't pay more than a hundred bucks for this huge mining rack in the background. The two power supplies are worth something, actually he's got four here, it looks like. He hasn't really done a great job listing all the specs apart from the cards unless the cards are the only things he's selling. But you know, we're literally thousands of dollars off here, there's just, we're just not even close. Now this next listing, largest mining rig yet in this video. So here you have it. GPU, Ethereum mine, 720 MH/s, is that right? I don't know. I don't know what metric they used. Anyway, $8,500 listed 19 weeks ago in Cheshire, Connecticut. You know, these are having problems selling folks. This is, these are huge red flags. If you've seen a listing like this and you're just wondering well I wonder if this is a good price or not. If the listing is still up here after 19 weeks maybe just walk away. There's plenty of other ads out there. Let's see, what other ads do we have here? Oh my gosh. Ethereum mining rig pays in Bitcoin though, to be clear but mine's a theory, I don't know what that means. $7,000 listed again 23 weeks ago in Baltimore, Maryland. I know you can't see that. My window's blocking it. Anyway, Ethereum Mining Grid contains the following cards. AMD Radeon RX6700XT, 12-gig, he has three of those. I'm assuming that's what the x3 means. He's got a single RX 6800XT, a single RX 6800 so five cards in total. He's got a power supply, rig, I'm assuming that's like the the chassis, monitor, keyboard, mouse and then an Nvidia GeForce GT1030, which I'm assuming he uses just like is a console stuff. I don't know. He probably doesn't have integrated graphics on the CPU. Anyway, the real value here, again, is in the cards. He doesn't even specify what power supply he's using or what other components are in this rig. It doesn't look like anything in here is super fancy. See that green PCB back there? So it's probably a pretty cheap motherboard. So I'm just gonna account for the price of the cards and then we'll tack on a few extra hundred dollars for the power supplies. So with my eBay graphing TI89+ calculator here. Let's see, 5 x 500, gee, I wonder what that could be. $2,500, worst case, for the lot of cards. And he wants $7,000 in total for this whole setup. I'm not sure where he is expecting to recoup the remaining $4,500 here. I just, I don't see it. And again, I'm not surprised. Miners are living in the past. I've got two more here. This one's - (laughing) this is pretty good. So he calls it miner Nvidia one 3090, six 3060, I don't know let me move this outta the way so you can see here. Yeah, $6,500 asking price listed in Bedford, Ohio. Plug and play on HIVEos Core i3 9100F, makes sense. You don't need an expensive processor. Six 3060s, he's got a Biostar BTC Pro 2.0. I don't know, I'm assuming this is the motherboard. I don't know. He's got I'm, well he's gonna have riser cables, of course. He's got a 500-gig SATA hard drive or SSD, I don't know. Corsair Vengeance Ipx 32-gig, six - What? Is it 32-gigs or 16-gigs, what is this? And then a power supply 1000 pl - 1000 watt 80+ Gold fully modular, okay and Veddha cooling fans. Strix Nvidia 3090, golly this is like such a choppy spec list. One of those, okay, \"it's been mining for roughly 30 days.\" I'm gonna go ahead and push the doubt button on this line, but we'll see. \"Built for a customer that couldn't finish making payments.\" Gee, this seems to be a recurring theme, maybe just don't bother. RTX 3060s are on here all day for $300 or less. You can get 3060 Tis for 300 bucks or less. So we're just gonna stick with $300 for that SKU and then we'll see what 3090s are selling for, at least what the asking is for these. $900, this is a defective card. That's $750 for that one, that's pretty cheap. Let's just say 900 bucks. Okay, so $900 for the 3090 and what? $300 for the 3060, you know what's coming? The TI89+ Universe Texas Instruments beast eBay calculator here. Let's go ahead and start off with the 3060s, he's got six of those x 300 that gives us a grand total of $1,800 plus another $900 for that optional 3090. That's a $2,700 graphics card budget. And he's got a couple power supplies. He's got the motherboard, he's got the Core i3, he's got the risers, he's got the chassis, the frame. Let's lump in another, I don't know, even a $1000 for all this stuff, used stuff, mind you. And we're still barely halfway to his asking price. Yeah, I don't think so. Last one then. And I don't even remember which one of these I selected. Oh yes, it's a nice looking mining setup, but it's expensive. This, by the way, is how I have to set up every single one of these. The F12 and then delete the buffers and left and right so that this thing gets centered. Then we full screen it. There we go. Little bit of behind the scenes action. So this is a crypto mining rig, six GPU 3070s. It's got it listed for $7,500, originally listed for $8,000 and it was all listed 15 weeks ago in Manchester, New Hampshire. Cards are four months old. Professionally built crypto mining rig will do 400, I'm assuming, again, I think this is mega hash per second or something like that. On Ethereum is, I don't know if this is even still the case because Ethereum switched to proof of work or proof of state, I forget which one again, I'm a mining newb. \"Cards have never exceeded 70 degrees temperature. Still have all the boxes for the new 3070 cards.\" Okay, well these aren't new, just to be clear. They've been mined with. \"Local pickup or delivery in New England.\" Okay, so let's get, right out of the gate, the fact that these are pretty clean, look, I mean, well, they look dusty, but this is a clean setup. It's a professional looking mining setup. Don't let that deter you, however, from the fact that the whole ad is just super over - Oh my gosh, they are actually pretty dusty. That is, that is pretty gross. I would've cleaned those up. Especially look at this one back here. There's like stuff growing in these, yeah, not the best, not the best look, just I don't know why people think this is okay to take pictures of this stuff and then throw it up there. Anyway, let's do some quick math. We know 3070s are selling for around $400 a piece. Let's go ahead and whip out, one last time here, our fancy, handy, dandy Texas Instruments mother lode beast of a calculator. Let's go. What is, it's 6 x 400. Hmm, I wonder what this could be. Four, $2,400, okay, that is less than half the price that he has this all listed for. He doesn't even list what the remaining specs are. Like the power supplies. I don't know. I don't know what this is here. I'm assuming it's not worth anything crazy, because he didn't bother listing them out. So we're just, we're just a few thousand dollars short my friend, like, like four grand short. (laughs) I'm not sure you're willing to come down that far but I have a pretty good feeling that if you don't this ad will be up here for another 15 weeks. So I hope you had fun with these. Look, there's, there's nothing too informative here other than the fact that yes, it may appear as though there are decent deals on ex mining rigs. You can snag a bunch of cards on the cheap but plenty of folks are still living in la-la land. And you gotta be careful, especially if a listing is local and you're thinking, \"oh I could go pick up these eight cards today\" and he's only asking for X amount of dollars. You've really gotta weigh it against what you could buy individual cards for on eBay. First off, on eBay, you get the buyer protection guarantee. If the card shows up and it's defective doesn't work, whatever, you can almost always get your money back. I don't think I've ever been screwed over by the buyer protection guarantee on the buyer's side. As the seller, I've had issues. But on the buyer's side, it's usually a done deal. If you buy local and you have no way to test before you exchange the cash for the products you could be screwed and you'll probably never be able to get in contact with that person again. So that's another risk of dealing locally. I would strongly recommend funneling through either Offer Up or eBay or something like that so that you have somebody on your side in case things go south. There's a lot of craziness out there. This ad aside, a lot of mining rigs are still extremely expensive. So just be careful out there.
