    "transcript": "Hey how is it going? Dave2D here. So this is a video on three completely different setups. They have nice aesthetics, they're great performers, but they're super expensive. Okay, first is the Razer Blade Pro Version 2. It's similar to the Razer Blade Pro I reviewed a few months ago, it's still running the 1080, it still has the mechanical RGB keyboard and the trackpad on the right, with a programmable scroll wheel. But it has faster RAM and overclockable CPU and THX certification. So, these speakers are amazing, they're as clear as the new MacBook speakers, but it has stronger bass and they can get super loud. The 17 inch display is also THX certified. It's excellent for content creation and gaming. It's color calibrated at the factory, it's got 4k resolution, it's bright and it's running G-Sync at 60 Hertz. It's not the quietest laptop and it's not the most powerful and with the new overclockable CPU, when you crank it up, the temperatures get pretty hot, but for gaming and video editing this is one of the best laptops on the market. For $4,000 though I would never call this a value oriented purchase, it's a very steep price tag, but it's awesome. Okay, next up is a desktop PC, this is a bare-bone's pre-built PC from ZOTAC. It's 5.85 liters in volume, it's really small. It's running a core i7 7700, a GTX 1080, but all the other stuff, you got to supply yourself. It costs $1,800 and I know you can build a custom PC for like $7, that would crush this thing in terms of performance for the money, but it wouldn't be this small and it wouldn't be this quiet. And those two things are pretty important to me. Inside it's running a samsung PM961, a 500 gig SSD and 32 gigs of RAM from Corsair. The BIOS gives you a good amount of fan control, you can keep the system running incredibly quiet if you want, and it will ramp up the fans, if you're doing heavier stuff. Gaming and video editing performance is surprisingly good, considering how compact the system is. The display is the 8K panel from Dell, the UP3218K. It has excellent color gamut and accuracy and it's crazy expensive. It retails for $5,000, the resolution is nuts. It's obviously aimed at the professional content creator, who's working with really high-res video or photo files and I've got to be honest: I'm not part of that demographic, but the screen is awesome. The camera I use is a Red Scarlet W. It shoots in 5K and before this display, I'd never seen the full 5K image before from my camera. At least not on one screen. I'd had to like zoom in and scope around to kind of see all the pixels, but now I can see all 5K. Regardless it's a really nice screen to edit videos with, it is in fact the sharpest display I ever used. It does need a pretty beefy graphics card to run it and you're using two DisplayPort cables to make it happen. 8K gaming is actually not too bad on the Zotac. It's pointless, though. I mean, I would never play games at this resolution, but it is viable for some games, if you're curious. I'm running some speakers from Kanto. They sound really good. These aren't particularly expensive speakers, but I like them because of their aesthetic: matte gray, clean design and they also connect over Bluetooth, so you have less wires. The keyboard is also wireless with Cyan GMK key caps and I also have a white Razer DeathAdder. There's one issue that I have with that setup and it's a problem that most people wouldn't have, but because I'm old and I have a kid and I have a pretty intensive job outside of Youtube, I don't like having that gaming PC around. So, I have terrible self control when it comes to PC games and I found over the years that the best way for me to kind of curve that addiction is to just not have a gaming PC. So, this is the setup I like the most: the trash can Mac Pro. It's three and a half years old, it's still stupidly overpriced, but fortunately I can't play Overwatch in Mac OS. It is the quietest desktop I've ever used and it's also one of the fastest that I've used for Adobe Premiere. It's running a 10 core CPU with 64 gigs of RAM and that's why I still use it. There's nothing on the market right now that has a five and a half liter case that crushes video edits like this and is also virtually silent. Now, as for why I like cases that are so small and so quiet... like... I don't know... I'm weird! I know most of you won't appreciate that kind of stuff, most of you don't care about things like that, but it is important to me. The display is the 38UC99 from LG. This thing goes for $1500. This is one of the more reasonably priced items in the video, but it's also my favorite display for edits. I actually prefer this thing over the 8K panel and for the stuff that I do, I think this display is perfect. It's bright, excellent color gamut and color accuracy, there's enough of a curve to give you a bit of immersion when you're watching videos, but it's not too distracting and it has USB-C input and the speakers in here aren't bad. I actually don't use speakers when I have it connected up to the Mac, just to keep things as clean as possible. But that's it, I hope you guys enjoyed this video, I mean there was no sponsor to this thing, there was no even purpose to this video, it's just to showcase three really cool setups that I've been able to use and I thought were really impressive, in case some of you have really big budgets and you want to go ham on buying a computer, well now you have three more options.",
