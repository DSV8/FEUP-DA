    "transcript": "*Dave 2D Noises* razer finally brought razer blade pro A 17 inch device All the stuff that kinda makes it look more modern It just took longer than I had expected They had their 15-inch device and their stealth, which were both updated to this new kind of unibody design and they didn't just update the 17-inch version for years. Turns out, they were waiting for this. The new 9th-gen laptop CPUs from Intel. Looking at the briefing notes it doesn't seem like a massive jump from the 8th gen CPUs.",
