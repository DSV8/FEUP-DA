    "transcript": "Hey, how is it going? Dave2d here. So, these are some 2017 MacBooks with the KabyLake chips and this are some 2016 MacBooks with the SkyLake chips. And originally I wanted to do individual reviews for all of these. And then I realized, would just be a better video if I kinda compared and contrasted all of these? So, you guys had a better idea on which one of these to purchase. If any of them at all. a brief summary of the new generation of MacBooks. So, this has aluminum build, fantastic build quality, even better than the previous 2015 body, screens are all nice and bright. The Pro models in particular, get really bright. So, the keyboards are now rocking second generation butterfly switches all round, that includes the 12\" MacBook, and to me that's a much nicer feeling keyboard than the first generation. The speakers are really good and And everytime I mention this there is Apple hater that comes out in the comments \"No, bro, product X or product Y has better speakers\" No, Apple has literally the BEST laptop speakers in the market right now. Whather you like or you hate them, it's just the facts.",
