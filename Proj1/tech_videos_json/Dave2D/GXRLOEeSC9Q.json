    "transcript": "Hey how's it going, guys? This is Dave 2D, and I want to do an update video on the Razer Blade Stealth. So this is the original Razer Blade Stealth. It came out around eight or nine months ago. Fantastic device. It's actually one of my top picks for ultrabooks in 2016. And this is the new one. It's updated with Kaby Lake from Intel. It's got 16 gigs of ram. Or you can get up to 16 GB of Ram. That's what this one's rocking. And third thing is that it's got an improved battery. The exterior hasn't changed at all. It's really prone to fingerprints and it's also prone to nicks. I actually put a skin on this one. It's been used by a lot of different people over the past eight or nine months. But when you have a skin, it just protects it. If you care about the finish of these laptops, I highly recommend getting a skin on it. These are from DBrand. They have ones that even cover the logo, if you wanna get rid of it. Now, the build quality is still awesome. If you watched my first video, you can kinda see the details as to why I like it so much. But the short of it is this: These laptops are built really well. I would consider them equal to something like the XPS line from Dell or the Macbooks from Apple. These are just really, really well built. The display options are unchanged and so are all the external features. So the speakers, the keyboard, the trackpad, the ports. If you wanna learn more about those, you can check the original review. On the inside, one of the things they haven't changed is the drive. So they're still using the Samsung PM951 Drive. It's an okay drive. I don't love it, mostly because at the lower capacities, the read speeds are okay. But the write speeds are really slow. And I don't love that. Especially for a PCIE drive. I really wish that they upgraded it to something a little bit faster this time. They haven't. The 16 GB of Ram is nice, but keep in mind that you have to configure this at the time of ordering. You can't bring it home and upgrade it because the ram is still soldered on. The battery's been upgraded And we'll talk about that with more details later. But the big thing is the Kaby Lake processor. It's now running an i7-7500U. The Kaby Lake version is faster. It's not supersonic or anything, but everything just feels a little bit snappier. It's not a huge difference, but it is noticeable. As for the differences in terms of Ram, that is where I feel is the biggest difference. 16 GB of Ram is really nice. For me, I use Chrome a lot. And if you have a lot of tabs open, there is a difference between an 8 and a 16 GB model. And also if you're doing video edits. The 16 GB of Ram is more much spacious, viable video editing environment. And the third thing, I hate to use this term, is future-proofing. Not that it really exists, but you're gonna get further into the future with 16 GB of Ram than 8 GB of Ram. The Razer Blade Stealth was never great at playing games to begin with, at least not until you tether it with a Razer Core. But if you're gaming on an integrated graphics the new HD620 is around 10 percent maybe 15 percent faster than the older HD520. So lighter games like CS:GO and DOTA 2, you'll be able to play them, you won't get amazing frame rates, you're not gonna be like MLG or anything, but it is a smoother experience with the HD620. In general though, it's gonna be a noticeable improvement. It's just not a huge improvement. Thermally, they're pretty similar. The Kaby Lake is cooler on idle and a little bit cooler even on load. Which is nice. But they're not that different in terms of actual use and comfort. I wouldn't really notice the difference between the two if I was just using them on my lap without a thermal cam. The other thing is noise. Fan noise is about the same between them, but because it has a more efficient chip, fans kick in less frequently on the Kaby Lake version. It's the new one, right? It better be that way. If you connect the Razer Blade Stealth to the Razer Core, you can get a huge improvement in gaming performance, depending on the card you have inside there. But I tried using the GTX 1080 Fantastic card, but there was no real difference between the Kaby Lake version and the Skylake version. Both of them played games at extremely good frame rates. But at that point, most of the work is being done by the GPU. The actual Kaby Lake chipset isn't improving gaming performance that much. But one of the really cool things that Kaby Lake does have is hardware encoding and decoding of some video codecs. In particular, V9 and H265. Complicated stuff, but basically things like Netflix and YouTube. When they push high quality video to you, your computer has to decode that stuff to be able to display it. And now that decoding is done on the chip. So it uses very little CPU power. You're getting less fan noise and longer battery life. Now that leads me to my favorite part about the Kaby Lake Stealth: the battery life. So, the old version on the Skylake chip you're getting around 5 and a half, 6 hours of battery life. Reasonable, kind of short in the ultrabook market, but still acceptable, considering what it is. This version: 7 and a half to 8 hours. Partially because of the Kaby Lake chip, it's a little more energy efficient. But it's also a bigger battery. So, 7 and a half to 8 hours is really nice, because to me, 8 hours is like the threshold for when you don't have to bring your charger to work or school. Because it'll last you the full day. And I really like that. So, overall: fantastic device to begin with. It's even better with the upgrades. Hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it. It's been nice. See you guys next time.",
