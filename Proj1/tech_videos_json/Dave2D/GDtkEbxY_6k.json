    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going Dave 2D here ! Let's talk about ultrabooks those thin and light laptops that are built for Productivity, and there's a lot of really good options to choose from in early 2018 We're looking at like XPS 13 razor blade stealth HP Envy the x1 from Lenovo all of them with 8th gen CPUs great devices but they're all Light but not super light and these two are the superlight Laptops that I would recommend for most people. So, these are the LG Gram devices the 13 inch and the 15 inch and what make some special is how incredibly light they are So, this thing comes in at 2 pounds most of the devices that I mentioned earlier are pushing three pounds, Maybe them a little bit more than that This is 2 pounds, and I mean when you're looking for a portable device a one pound reduction in weight is massive and these things are just so comfortable to hold so when you make something this thin in this light you're gonna have some compromises you can't have something of this weight and expect to be able to treat it poorly It is built well much better built than the original 14-inch LG Gram But it's still something to take care of I would get a sleeve or something to protect it, the magnesium alloy is strong but it can't beat physics. All right. Let's talk about the things that I do like about it first the screen This is a 1080p touchscreen, it needs a little bit of calibration to be accurate, but it has great color gamut And it gets reasonably bright the backlit keyboard and the trackpad are both good. Now I wouldn't consider them to be best in class or anything But I'm very happy using them. The 8th gen CPU on both these devices are nice now These are a nice step up from the previous generation when it comes to multi-core performance But to be fair the improved performance isn't something most Ultrabook users will be able to notice you do need particular apps to show that off properly It is an 8th gen CPU so you do get better battery life as well speaking of battery life these both have 60 watt hour batteries and The software in here can be set pretty aggressively so you're like sipping at the battery and you can get like 15 hours or something ridiculous, but for regular use 250 nits on the screen I'm getting around 8 and a half hours on the 13 inch version around seven and a half hours on the 15 inch version It's a little bit less because there's just a bigger screen more stuff to light up okay I want to talk about the 15 inch device for a second And I think this is a pretty unique product a lot of 15-inch laptops have 15-inch screens with 45 watt HQ processors And I get it a lot of people that want that bigger screen also want a faster processor more powerful processor But some people don't want that some people just want a bigger screen And they just don't need the extra processing power that every other company is stuffing down their throats This thing is still running a 15 watt U processor and almost everything remains the same It is a little more roomy and there's a number pad on the keyboard, but it's a thin and light 15 inch laptop Which is rare, okay? Let's talk about some things like don't love about it first and the big one for me is the webcam it's located in The hinge so when you use it it kind of looks up your nose, and then the speaker's don't sound great They're pretty mediocre and the last thing is a charging port so they include a barrel plug as the AC adapter I really wish they'd include a USB C charger because it can take it where you need to go and buy your own USB C charger Which is unfortunate so both the 13 and the 15-inch? LG gram are just great options for people looking for something really portable and just an all-around great laptop This one in particular the 13-inch one. I think is actually on sale on Amazon right now for 800 bucks Not sorry not the 8th gen one But the previous generation the seventh gen which is very similar in performance and everything else across the board. That's a steal 800 bucks I don't know if it's like a Black Friday thing or like a holiday special But that's a really good price for something that originally launched like 11-1200 bucks I'll leave a link for all this stuff below You know what there's one other thing when I talk about If you're interested in portable stuff everyone knows this mouse right the MX master series It's smaller sibling is not as well known I feel like this thing is actually a better Mouse than the big one for a lot of people one It's just a smaller fit the MX master is a really large Mouse And I think a lot of people that have seen it are intimidated by it And it's just not a great travel Mouse This thing is half the size a little bit cheaper same sensor same super long battery really like this thing This is the MX. Anywhere 2 s ok hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs. We liked it subs of you loved it See you guys next time",
