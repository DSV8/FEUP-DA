It is one  of the best looking laptops I've seen this year. Spec'd out with a GTX 1070 Max-Q and the i7-8750H, it has awesome gaming performance and is still one of the best gaming laptops you can get in 2018\n\nBackground Music - The Break\n\nIf you want to support the channel, consider a Dave2D membership by clicking the “Join” button above!\n\nhttp://twitter.com/Dave2D\nhttp://www.instagram.com/Dave2D\nhttps://discord.gg/Dave2D\n\nPurchases made from store links may give me some money. \n(It doesn’t cost you extra, so please buy everything)",
