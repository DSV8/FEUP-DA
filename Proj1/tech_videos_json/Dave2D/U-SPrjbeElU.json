    "description": "Dave2D review of Huawei P30 and P30 Pro. The night camera is lit, the 50X zoom is gimmicky. Solid phone but i dunno if it beats the Samsung Galaxy S10 devices\nPhone skins from - https://www.dbrand.com\n\nFast phones with amazing cameras are made by every single company but are the P30 and P30 Pro enough to compete? The kirin processor feels very fast but the software needs some work still.\n\nBackground Music Fili - Up Coast\n\nIf you want to support the channel, consider a Dave2D membership by clicking the “Join” button above!\n\nhttp://twitter.com/Dave2D\nhttp://www.instagram.com/Dave2D\nhttps://discord.gg/Dave2D\n\nPurchases made from store links may give me some money. \n(It doesn’t cost you extra, so please buy everything)",
