    "transcript": "Hey how's it going? Dave2D here This is Lenovo's Thinkpad P1. This is a workstation laptop that's geared for professional use. You can play games on it obviously because it's got a respectful graphics card but it's not geared for gaming in particular. So this device is a thin and light workstation. It's built around portability and I think it looks really good. It's covered in this soft touch material. Now normally soft touch materials on laptops aren't my thing. Normally they just degrade over time. I find that alot of the laptops that are covered in the traditional soft touch material just become gunky after a year or two. This material feels a little bit different It doesn't show fingerprints readily and from my experience with the soft-touch materials from lenovo this stuff lasts a very long time. It's very durable finish. Even a year or two later it looks pretty much brand new. The ports on this device are good. There's a bunch of USB-A, there's 2 thunderbolt 3's on the left and there's also an SD card slot on the right.",
