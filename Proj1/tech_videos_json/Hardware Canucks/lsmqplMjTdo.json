    "transcript": "hey everyone Eber here with Hardware Canucks and this is the cooler master hyper 212 black edition CPU cooler it now comes in this awesome gunmetal matte black finish that looks absolutely gorgeous with the brushed aluminum texture on the front and I just love it I just love the way how it looks I mean I love anything matte black if it's a phone or you know coffee mug or heck even my car actually I had to manually wrap that but anyways coming back to the point we've seen an exponential growth in terms of computer components receiving the RGB treatment and of course aggressive design elements to that might be appealing to some of you out there but it's always refreshing to see companies go back to the drawing board and perfect some of their very popular components from you know 5 or 10 years ago to make them even better and that's exactly what defines the hyper 212 black edition the best part is that this thing only cost $35 so I was actually wondering what kind of performance can you expect when you decide to upgrade to a cooler of this caliber from your traditional stock cooler that comes out of the box with your CPU regarding if it's Intel or AMD so that's exactly what we're going to find out right after this optimize your desk space with the surahs new gram spectrum TTL keyboard with a compact steel frame and low-profile keycaps removable cable and sweet illumination plus your choice of the source agile blue or red switches to satisfy those fingers sieve the gram spectrum TTL keywords for you links below alright so most of you should be familiar with the way how this cooler functions it's still a basic design that still happens to be one of the best for the price you pay so you get four heat pipes on each side connected to the cold plate installation also was pretty straightforward cooler master does include brackets for both AMD and Intel unfortunately this won't work on tr4 they now include this 120 millimeter Silencio fan that's supposedly really quiet during idle and load operations plus they simply attach to the heatsink via these metal clips you can also add another 120 millimeter fan at the back if you wish to go for a push-pull configuration and I appreciate Cooler master for including an extra set of clips for that now for testing purposes I'll be using this $1,000 AMD pay system that I built a while ago and I've been using this to test the latest adrenaline and 2019 Edition drivers to see what their new features are like and it's been great so far but it has been rocking the Wraith spire cooler that came out of the stocke CPU so I thought it would be a great example I guess a great use case scenario to see what kind of temperatures can we expect when we decide to upgrade to this bad boy now the specs in the system includes a Ryzen 5 2600X with 16 gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance lpx memory I've also got an XFX rx 590 Fatboy graphics card all sitting on an MSI p450 tomahawk motherboard and in the case of choice is the phanteks p300 and i will be running all of these tests with the sight palettes closed just so we get a more realistic use case scenario when you have the PC right beside you but I know a lot of you guys may be wondering why I decided to go with a 2600X versus a 2600 and the simple answer to that is that the 2600X has a 95 won TDP rating compared to the 65 watt TDP rating on the 2600 so it actually flexes or pushes the limits on these coolers when it comes to performance so without any further ado let's check out the results now I ran prime95 for 15 minutes to stress test the CPU both at stock and overclock settings now the 2600X at stock settings with the rates bar cooler yielded around 37 degrees Celsius idle and 92 degrees Celsius under full load with the fan speed set to its default setting I did manage to increase the fan rpm all the way up to 2800 which did result in lower temps but the acoustic performance was not that great take a listen for yourselves now switching over to the hyper 212 black edition and I saw temps around 33 degrees Celsius and under load it only got as far as 62 degrees Celsius with fan speed set to 1,400 rpm and the best part was the acoustic performance was phenomenal here's a quick comparison between it and the stock core so right off the band you can certainly tell that there's a significant decrease in temperatures when you decide to upgrade from the stock cooler to an aftermarket solution like the hyper 212 black edition now I also did some overclocking to see how this cooler can handle it and I used the rising master software to overclock the 2600X to 4.15 gigahertz at one point four to five volts but the sad news is that I was not able to get a stable overclock with this stock or installed every time after I run prime95 runs 6 minutes the system just crashed and just wasn't able to keep up I even tried increasing the fan speed all the way up to 2,000 or more well over 2,000 and again the system just crashed because a stock core is just so tiny so I can only do so much and it just wasn't able to handle the overclock but the hyper 212 black edition did pretty well so we're talking around 37 degree Celsius idle and 90 degrees Celsius under load which is still hot but remember the fan speed was set to about 1,400 rpm bumping that up to 2,000 did bring down the temperature significantly and the acoustic performance was also very respectable all right so I think it's safe to say that upgrading from your stock holder to something a little bit more robust can certainly help bring down those temperatures I mean even with the fan speed set to its max setting I was barely able to hear the system which was awesome but there are some other factors to consider first and foremost the case of choice the p300 is certainly not the best case when it comes to air flow it certainly has some restrictions so if you were to switch that out for a case that has better front intakes that would have certainly helped decrease OCP temperatures on both the stock and this cooler as well another important thing to consider is even at load at the stock settings with the CPU the clock speeds weren't hitting above 4 gigahertz at least during my test so certainly overclocking the CPU can help bring up those 2 clock speeds at a consistent rate and I think that's important especially if you plan on doing some rendering work could that could potentially help take advantage of those higher clock frequencies so a lot of factors to consider especially when you're planning on building your system within a certain budget and again for $35 this cooler surprised me in a lot of ways so that concludes its video I hope you guys enjoyed this one let me know what you guys think about the 212 black edition from Cooler master I mean for $35 would you consider upgrading to this from your traditional stock cooler and also if you're looking to see comparisons between this and perhaps the ones from Noctua are you interested in something like that a lot tune your thoughts in the comments down below I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to
