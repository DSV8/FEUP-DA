    "transcript": "hey everyone Eber here with Hardware Canucks and today we are putting together one of our fastest AMD gaming / workstation PC this build solely revolves around AMD's x570 platform which is their latest offering as well as embracing their brand new Ryzen 9 processor which is an absolute beast and taking advantage of their flagship 5700 series GPU so this build is gonna be epic until a new drivers crash on me now I do want to take this time to explain why we haven't posted our Ryzen 3000 series review and that simply because we've been experiencing some odd boost behaviors with the motherboards that were sent to us there were also other reports reported online as well so we weren't 100% confident in publishing a review until we were you know certain that these new CPUs perform as per AMD's spec now we decided to instead publish a build video featuring one of their new processors to give you a snapshot in terms of what you can expect in terms of performance so if anything changes we will definitely make sure to give you guys an update on that so yeah definitely expect a lot more rise in content coming in the next few weeks now coming back to the build I do want to make this visually appealing without adding too much RGB into the mix but rather unify the color of individual components inside the system so I believe all the components that are sitting in front of me fit that criteria so let's get started but first a quick message from our sponsor the newbie quiet dark rock slim cooler offers high physical clearance for any memory module thanks to its slim heatsink and the low profile 120 mil airflow optimized fan so you get great cooling low noise easy installation and no issues for high profile Ram check it out below at the heart of the system lies the writes in 9 3,900 X this is Amy's first 12 core 24 threaded processor for the aim for platform the boost clocks go as far as 4.6 gigahertz according to AMD and it has 64 megabytes of l3 cache intel has certainly left the chat our motherboard of choice is the asrock x5 70 Taichi and this thing is packed with features like a metal backplate an entire thermal armor that also acts as a heat sink for the 3 PCI Gen 4 slots so this should definitely help improve dissipation for the Chandpur drive that will be popping into one of these slots more on that in just a bit the IO is loaded with USB three-point to Gen 1 ports a couple of USB 3.2 gen to 10g ports and more Plus this board does support Wi-Fi 6 which is awesome also I love the effects of this board and it's not shy while we're clocking to asrock has implemented their best power phase design so it's very refreshing to see motherboard manufacturers not skimp on enthusiast level features on the m4 platform cool nd 3,900 X is the Animax lick tech 3 60 millimeter a aia cooler it is white in color so it definitely fits the theme that were going for in the first place as for RAM I chose Corsair Vengeance RGB 2 times 32 gigabyte kits so total of 64 gigabytes and we're populating all four dims as for storage or has hooked us up with a 2 terabyte Gen 4 and me me drive and what's special about this particular drive is all for starters given that it supports the latest PCI Gen 4 protocol the read and write speeds are off the charts I mean we're talking 5 gigabytes per second read and over 4 gigabytes per second right now it's not gonna yield you higher FPS but in this case given that it is constant find as a Gen 4 drive cooling is certainly an important factor to consider but it looks like Oris has figured that out because they've actually included a copper heat saying that goes on top of the drive and I could admit this thing is as heavy as my smartphone which is just absolutely insane this thing is a tank guys you really have to you know hold it and kind of feel in your hands but unfortunately in our case I won't be able to take advantage of this particular heat sing because the thermal armor on the azure motherboard is geared for all of those two slots so we're just going to wait and see how that can efficiently cool the Gen 4 Drive given its rated speeds moving on to our graphics card and we chose the rx 5700 XT and as I'm opening the box it's not there because it's how my test bench and I have to get it out for the build but nonetheless I'm pretty sure a lot of you guys know about what the GPU is and what can what it can offer in fact if you're interested in a full performance review you can check out our link right over here we compare it with our TX super cards and what anybody has to offer so that is what we're going with powering our entire build is beak straight power 10 700 watt 80 plus gold modular power supply this thing is plenty enough to power the 3900 X and the 5700 XT we're also pairing this PSU with cable mods mod flex white and black kit it should suit our color scheme pretty well our case of choice is the fractal design measure Phi s 2 and we went with the white and black variant with the tempered glass panel and it looks absolutely gorgeous I mean this case doesn't skimp on things like air flow and it can comfortably accommodate our 360 millimeter high or cooler so that's awesome in fact if you're interested in a full in-depth review you can check out Dmitry's video right over here so with all that out of the way let's put this thing together so the build is finally complete and I have to be honest it's one of the coolest looking pcs that are built in a while simply because the color of individual components blends in really well with each other the 360 monaro matches perfectly with the case so does the memory modules I think the only issue that I had was with the LED lighting of individual components so the azrog motherboard actually outputs a white that isn't white there's actually a little bit of a purple hue on top of that so I had to play around with the RGB channels to match the memory modules so that that certainly took some time and it was a challenging process but if there is a motherboard vender thinking about an all-white motherboard I am so down for it the red Radeon logo on the 5700 XT does add a nice accent color to this entire build I mean I wanted to throw in something that screamed or something that added that team red finish so it happened to do the job just fine also let me know what you guys think about the vertical GP positioning of that graphics card do you prefer it that way or should I switch back to the standard horizontal mount let me know in the comments down below alright so now it's time to evaluate the performance on the 3900 X and the 5700 XT now do keep in mind that I ran all of these tests and stock setting I'll be it I did enable precision boost over drive through AMD's rise and master software and I will touch on the overclocking experience with this processor in just a bit but let's start off with some synthetic tests starting with cinema r15 the multi-core score was over 3,000 points and to give you a little bit of context my 8,700 case called 1630 when overclocked to 5 gigahertz and this is the processor that I used for my everyday video editing workflow and compared to my previous AMD bill which is a little bit more on the affordable side featuring the Ryzen 5 2600X yeah it's where we expected it to be now moving on to blender running the BMW benchmark the 3900X took less than three minutes to complete that task and when I compared to something like the 87 Andrew K overclocked to 5 gigahertz that took well over 4 minutes and the 2600 X took over 6 minutes to complete it so this 12 core 24-hour CPU is an absolute monster when it comes to multi-core performance moving on to our Adobe Premiere Pro test and boy interesting stories of statite this is an all AMD based system it is running AMD drivers so as I was playing back this 12 minute 4k project it is our standard benchmark for Adobe Premiere Pro the program monitor was completely glitching out on me and as you can see it is not pleasing to the eye and it certainly isn't feasible for content creation or just the experience as an whole but as soon as I hit the spacebar key which stops the playback it displays the image just fine so it's definitely a driver optimization issue with Adobe Premiere and AMD and this is a big red flag especially if you're considering picking up the 5700 XT and if you're thinking about you know both gaming and doing a little bit of content creation and if you plan on using Adobe Premiere Pro yeah not so well but but this is the most fun part it actually managed to render the entire project without a problem using Adobe Media encoder and here are the results and as you can see my 8700 K is still faster and that's thanks to Intel Quick Sync but that being said the 3900X is not too far behind it still manages to complete or render that video just a little over 12 minutes but to give you a little bit of context if I were to compare this 12 cores here to a 6-quart 12 30 2600X the difference is pretty significant and that's obviously due to the thread count but I also want to mention that if you're planning on building a system specifically for Adobe creative applications I would highly recommend Intel going the Intel platform because QuickSync can come in super handy for those Suites but if you're planning on building a system for say DaVinci Resolve or other applications that can take image of multi-core horizon is the way to go moving on to gaming performance and I noticed a major issue you see for some reason my 3d mark 5 strike scores were so low so I decided to monitor my GPU clock speeds and I noticed that it wouldn't go over to 70 megahertz so basically it wouldn't switch from 2d mode to 3d mode when it's doing something graphically intensive now we assume that the graphics card and the motherboard would switch automatically to Gen 3 mode and given that we're using a gen 3 riser card but that wasn't the case because it was ultimately a signal interruption issue so if you plan on building a system with an x570 motherboard and if d7x t he planted vertically mounting it you are definitely gonna run into this issue now if you're using the 5700 XT on an X470 platform or something that doesn't use the pc engine for interface you should be okay but luckily the as romp x5 sunny tech she had the option within the bios to change the x16 the top slot to gen 3 config so that's what I did and everything turned out to be just fine with all of that sorted I was finally able to run some gaming benchmarks and as you can see this system is an absolute beast most replayed titles will comfortably hit over 100 frames per second like battlefield 1 overwatch and apex legends these are all at the highest percent I shadowed the Tomb Raider far cry 5 and Warhammer 2 where slightly depending on the 5700 XT but it was completely playable I do want to quickly touch base on the gen 4 SSD from Oris and as you can see it just flies I mean we're talking 5 gigabytes per second read over 4 gigabytes per second right it's crazy fast I mean if you are someone who can take advantage of all of this bandwidth then the gen 4 SSD is for you but I also wanted to monitor the temperatures and the tunnels of this drive and I used my thermal camera and it looks like it does the job pretty well the thermal armor on the asrock motherboard seems to cool or efficiently dissipate the heat coming off of that drive it is a hot spot but it seems to do the job and finally I want to wrap things up with my overclocking experience on the 3900 X so I was able to get this 12 core 24 32 CPU to 4.25 gigahertz at one point three seven five volts and I did make sure to run prime95 at a 64 stress test even ran some synthetic benchmarks to make sure it's stable and as you can see by these multi-core tests there isn't a substantial improvement over stock settings single core performance does take a hit and that's because the core frequencies are constant at 4.20 gigahertz so they don't boost because if I switch back to stock settings the core frequencies actually fluctuate between 4.1 and 4.2 Hertz they never hit 4.6 gigahertz which is what AMD claims that the CPU hits but I never saw it hit that frequency so that is certainly something that we want to investigate in the future so definitely stay tuned for that honestly if you want my opinion I would just leave the CPU at stock settings it performs like a champ and if you've paired up with some faster memory you're sent you wouldnt have to worry about temperatures or anything like that so that's that's my take on overclocking for now speaking of temperatures they wear under control under low during both stock and overclock settings I didn't see them rising over ADC so that's nice the new hydro x-series from Corsair is a full water cooling eco system with transparent blocks for RGB goodness and built-in flow indicators with soft and hard to being available and the full array of fittings so you can design the perfect loop for you hide your X by Corsair everything's linked below so that's the build guys let me know what you guys think about in the comments down below are there any specific components or alternative components that would have better fit this pc most importantly are there any other tests that you'd like us to run on this particular system I'm curious to know about that in the comments down below again stay tuned for more content on risin 3000 we certainly have a lot of digging up to do but that about wraps it up for now thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe to our boot sequence Channel I'm signing off and I'll see you guys in the next one",
