    "transcript": "[Music] hello good people Eber here with Hardware Canucks and MSI challenged us to build a budget themed gaming PC around the B450 platform essentially this build should be able to game at 1080p without a problem you should also be able to do general productivity tasks as well as a little bit of streaming so it's really geared towards ah you know an all-in-one type of system that can do pretty much everything that you can throw at it nothing too intensive something that's in the middle ground when it comes to productivity gaming and of course a little bit of streaming as well so we agree to that and as you can see I do have it set up right behind me so let's check it out right after this so you're saying this is the most colorful way to cool I'm telling you the master liquid ML360R RGB is the way to go cooler masters new 360 millimeter all in one liquid cooler is all about performance in style with the custom low resistance radiator and dual chamber pump with sleeve tubing for that premium look while being totally flexible the fan strike a balance for air pressure and airflow with transparent blades to perfectly match the colorful combination of the pump that you can sync via its own controller or through various addressable and 12-volt RGB connectors alright perhaps you should check it out in the description below all right so our CPU of choice was the Ryzen 5 2600X priced at $230 it's about 30 dollars more than the 2600 but since it has a TDP of 95 Watts versus 65 watts for the 2600 overclocking headroom will be a little bit better this is because things like XFR 2 and precision boost too will take advantage of the additional power headroom the six core 12 thread design may be a little bit overkill for games but at the same time the intent for this build is an all-around PC for work streaming and gaming moving on to the real foundation of this build meet the MSI B450 Tomahawk and you can pick this up for as low as $100 now I know that pairing up a hundred dollar motherboard with a $230 processor may sound a bit crazy but hear me out for a second because I think DB450 lineup is actually a lot better for these types of Ryzen 2 builds than the more expensive X470 platform first and foremost the B450 chipset only supports a single GPU but at the same time in this price range who is really going to be using crossfire or SLI anyways past that AMD has equipped it with pretty much all the same technology as the X470 just with a little bit less connectivity all around now this point in time you're probably wondering why you should buy a B450 motherboard over a B350 since both technically support D bars and two processors first and foremost is the new chipsets compatibility with AMD's StoreMI technology StoreMI allows you to combine an SSD hard drive and part of the system memory as local cache for a very fast very efficient storage setup think of it as optane on steroids and I'll be covering a head-to-head comparison between AMD StoreMI technology and intel optane so definitely stay tuned for that video very soon now instead of simply updating their B350 board MSI took the B450 Tomahawk to a very different route and that's why i ended up choosing it for this build other than the cool overall design which looks absolutely amazing for $100 it features a more extended PWM heatsink design there's also finally a BIOS flashback option which actually works without a CPU or memory installed also if things go wrong during the BIOS update process it will simply allow you to revert to an older version without any issues probably the best thing about B450 is its ability to overclock Ryzen processors now that might not sound like news but remember the competing Intel H370 which costs about the same amount of money doesn't allow for any overclocking at all which is disappointing the amount of features you get for the price you pay is pretty amazing as well for example MSI added USB 3.1 gen2 type A and type C connectors on the rear i/o there's an NVMe M.2 slot with access to four PCI lanes for ultra fast storage speeds and six fan headers placed at pretty logical locations of course MSI also added some onboard RGB lighting and compatibility with their mystic light sync speaking of lighting if you want to add some flair to your PC and by that I meant by just adding some subtle RGB lighting the Enermax T.B. RGB fans are an excellent addition they feature these unique halo arc illuminations around the frame that I'm personally a huge fan of plus they can easily be synced to be an MSI mystic lighting software which is nice and remember this is just an option so if you're willing to expand your budget for this build investing in some great RGB fence like the Enermax T.B. is something to consider for memory I went with Corsairs 16GB DDR4 Vengeance LPX modules rated at 2400 MHz now these guys go for around $150 and it's refreshing to go with something a non RGB and low profile it also matches the B450 Tomahawk board really well because I do want to mention the speed of this memory module because it is at 2400MHz and while it can be overclocked to a more respectable 2666 MHz Ryzen does perform a little bit better with faster memory saving some money and going with a 2400 MHz kit and then overclocking a bit might be a good option alright so for storage I chose the Toshiba RC100 240GB NVMe SSD this little guy cost less than $80 and sports reads speeds well about 1.6GB per second and writes over a gigabyte per second again for $80 and that's incredible considering that there are SATA base SSDs in the market for that price now for storing my game library I threw in a 1.0TB Western Digital Blue Caviar hard drive which should do the trick but I did find a 2TB 5400 RPM hard drive on Amazon for around $60 which is about the same price as the one terabyte drive now onto the graphics card which is the most exciting part and I went with MSI's RX 580 MECH 8GB OC now this thing is designed for better cooling over the reference based models the OC mode allows you to achieve core clock speeds as far as 1390 megahertz with memory clock speeds over 8000 megahertz it features dual Torx 2.0 fans for effectively cooling the six millimeter copper heat pipes located underneath a large heatsink the fans stop spinning completely when the GPU temps are below 60C giving users the flexibility when it comes to acoustic performance you also get a solid brushed aluminum backplane with some aggressive design elements and the LED logo on the side is RGB so you can control that through MSI's gaming app powering the whole system is Corsairs CX550 non-modular PSU with an 80 plus bronze certification for $50 this should be more than enough to power the 2600X and the RX 580 plus it does have a little bit of room for upgradability down the road now given that this is a non modular unit you're pretty much stuck with the cables that come with it so if you're looking to go a bit beyond the budget we have over here to maybe add some visual elements to your build CableMod's Basic ModFlex extension kits will be an excellent addition as it's simply an extension rather than a full kit for the psu plus around $35 it comes in a variety of color options so that's pretty awesome the case of choice for this build is the Phanteks P300 Mid Tower ATX enclosure for $60 I think it's an awesome buy because it comes with a tempered glass side panel a separate power supply shout RGB lighting integrations clean interior designed to work with and personally speaking I really like its relatively compact form factor I went with the black and white version which is priced a little bit higher than the standard edition but you're really not losing anything in terms of features aside from the color options so that's nice well now that we've taken a look at the parts list here's a little montage of me putting together the entire PC [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and here is the final build in all its glory I'm actually really happy with the way how this turned out working the Phanteks P300 case is an absolute breeze you're really not gonna have any issues with cable management because I certainly didn't experience any of them whatsoever routing them to inside the main chamber they do have separate cutouts so that's great the white interior does a really good job showcasing the B450 Tomahawk motherboard from MSI what's really cool about this white interior that's inside the P300 case is that it diffuses the ambient lighting on the motherboard really well so I really like that also shout-out to Phanteks for including a subtle RGB element right between the tempered glass panel and the separate power supply shroud it just completes the whole built in my opinion and looks fantastic I mean you can just literally take a look at it behind me it looks great I absolutely love the way how this looks so having looked at this PC we obviously have to talk about performance so why don't we get into that now initially I decided to go with the stock cooler that came with the Ryzen 2600X but for my previous reviews in the past I did mention that if you want to squeeze a little bit of performance by overclocking the chip or if you do intend to plan some overclocking for the 2600X you're actually much better off investing in an aftermarket cooling solution so I decided to swap the stock cooler with Thermaltake's Floe Riing 240mm AIO cooler and not only does it come with a high performance waterblock sleeve tubings but it also has RGB lighting so if you do want to add lighting to your system without investing in LED strips or under go lighting this is a good way to save cost on that end but it also squeezes a little bit of performance out of the 2600X the two 120 millimeter high static pressure fans come with this beautiful frame elimination that looks very subtle and sleek and interestingly this kit also works with Amazon Alexa talk about controlling fan speeds with your voice that's pretty cool anyways back to performance and I managed to overclock the 2600X to 4. 125 gigahertz at 1.42 5 volts using Ryzen master software the memory speed also was set to 2400 megahertz given that this is an inexpensive Ryzen compatible kit I ran a few synthetic tests comparing stock versus overclock settings to see if there is a difference and I shouldn't be expecting but let's take a look kicking things off with Cinebench R15 at stock settings we got a score of 1300 and with chip or clocked at four point one two five gigahertz we got us a bump on that score by seventy six points which isn't too bad but I'll take that any time of the day next up with Blender rendering the BMW seen at stock settings the system took 6 minutes and 12 seconds to complete it compared to 5 minutes and 39 seconds with the overclock moving on to some productivity and I mean I did really push this chip really hard with 4K editing so I rendered a 12 minute 4K project with GH5 footage and its stock saying the system took 24 minutes and 51 seconds compared to 23 minutes and 50 seconds with the overclocked so you're really gonna be saving only a minute which isn't too much but at least did something and now on to some gaming performance starting off with 3D Mark Firestrike the system scored 12804 with stock settings compared to 12844 with the overclock again very similar performance moving on to Battlefield 1 at 1080p set to ultra settings we pretty much saw similar results albeit I did experience a little bit of a frame drop with the overclock and then we have Overwatch at 1080p set 2 epic settings again same results here with both settings averaging well over a hundred and ten frames per second our last test here is Doom at 1080p set to ultra using the Vulcan API and as you can see once again we're seeing similar results with both of stock and overclocked settings averaging well over 145 frames per second the CP temperatures were respectable at stock sinks with the stock cooler the 2600X ran at 34C idle and 75C under load but with the overclock using the Thermaltake Floe AIO cooler the 2600X ran around 74 degrees celsius under load and 46 degree Celsius during idle now we want to add some peripherals to complete this setup and we chose MSI's GK40 Vigor gaming combo set and this comes with a basic RGB membrane keyboard and of course the basic mouse it gets a job done and for $65 we've we thought that there was a perfect fit for this build and when you put together the parts list on Amazon at the time of making this video including an operating system and of course the MSI a peripheral scent you're looking at around just a tad above thousand dollars which is actually a really good system or i guess a good setup for the price do note that this is excluding the Thermaltake AIO cooler when you add that factor in you're looking at just a little bit over $1300 for our Canadian audience memoryexpress is a place to go for home business and gaming electronics you can try before you buy especially great for peripherals by visiting one of their stores in Winnipeg Calgary or Greater Vancouver and more they do custom PCs and will beat any Canadian price guaranteed and that about wraps up this bill video hope you guys enjoyed let me know what you guys think about the components that I have chosen for this particular PC also what do you guys think about the way how it looks are you a fan of it are you not a fan of it love to know your thoughts in the comments down below huge thanks to MSI and our other partners for making this video possible I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching make sure to check out some relevant content over here subscribe to our new boot sequence Channel and I'll see you all in the next one",
