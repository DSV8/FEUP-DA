    "transcript": "good people after many years of not venturing into water-cooling adventures I am finally here with the help of Corsair and the entire Hydra X series this will be my second water cooling build and we're going all out just in case I have any questions I have Hans who is the product marketing manager for the Heydrich series you're a water cooling enthusiast yourself how many years have you been doing water cooling and how many systems do you think you've done like last year oh well about 12 or 13 years in the last year probably seven eight nine systems so I'm in the right hands in case I have any questions this should be fun privacy dot-com might also be fun but let's use virtual credit cards for online merchants so your real bank information stay secured with real-time transaction monitoring more on that later so I decided to water cool my Threadripper system the 2950X rtx 2080 I I have promised to give you an update on the system and it's finally happening I didn't want to just pop in the regular CPU cooler in there really wanted to go over the top and the Corsair 680 X was my choice of case from Corsair this thing is large enough so that when we're building inside and bending all the tubes it's not too cramped but it's not too large of a case either and I love that second compartment at the back where we can fit the reservoir pop combo all the cables so all the cable mess is out of sight and hopefully I'll just be left with this beautiful machine that will are all silent and cool for many years to come preparation it it takes so much more than just selecting a few hardware components and putting everything together when doing water cooling you have to make sure that your GPU matches your GPU block that you have enough fittings the right type of tubing so definitely preparation is the whole game when doing water cooling so the configurator is a great baseline to understand how many radiators you can fit inside a particular enclosure and then obviously we did go with a little bit of upgrades with bigger radiators and more fittings so that we could have a bit more comfortable loop in terms of bending all the hard line tubing and this is something that I know everyone talks about is very challenging when it comes to water cooling but we have the HP here so he's gonna definitely help me he has warned me that I'm gonna not do so well with the first few tubes but we'll see how I do at least brought the heat gun so that's gonna be fun I'm really happy to bring guys along on this journey so now let's do the parts breakdown so here's the entire water clink parts list and it is quite intimidating in the beginning to think about everything you'd need so that's why the configure it exists to give you a baseline so let's start with the basics the cooling blocks this is the xc9 RGB CPU water block compatible world LGA 2066 and tr4 it is transparent for illumination purposes and you can actually see the cooling plate in there to the top housing is aluminum despite it looking like plastic and we already have the thermal paste pre applied in honeycomb pattern and you can rotate the mounting plate to fit your loop design and direction for the GPU block we got the XG 7 RGB for my 2080 TI Strix love the design of the aluminum and again we have more transparency for lighting plus a visible flow indicator thermal pads are pre applied the kind that is only sticky on one side so they are reusable with thermal paste on the die area the included backplate is clean with cutouts to reveal more of the PCB and the finish assembly is just so gorgeous the Corsair branding is minimal I appreciate that the card is now 1/2 slots instead of almost 3 and in this very heavy toe and you have to hide the lighting cable somehow I am using dual XR 5 280 Miller ad ators one at the top and one on the bottom is said to exhaust so the front of the case is just tasked with delivering fresh air and I initially wanted a 360 rad at the front but that would dump all the heat into the case so that's why we went with dual to ATS instead and exhaust now since the case already has three ll 120 fans at the front we are using the 140 mils on the radiators to keep things consistent they are only 1300 rpm but are fairly quiet at 25 DBA and here's the collection of hard line fittings will be using standard 14 millimeter OD fittings that come in a set of four these 90 degree rotary adapters for the GPU block and these other 90 degree fittings for the reservoir CPU blog and the you block too if you want to cheat a little bit this 90 degree adapter lets me connect two tubes in a 90 degree Bend instead of me actually doing the bending on the tube itself and this very crucial adapter known as the drain port that is installed at the bottom the case so you can flush the liquid when needed I get all these fittings in black but silver ones are also available if that fits your color style there is more slash pump combo is the xd5 RGB it is high performance pwm controlled and powered by molex if you cool accessories include a g1 quarter-inch temperature sensor that you just screw into one of the fittings there's an ATX jumper for the 24 pins so you can fill the loop and 120 / 140 mm fan brackets so the XD 5 has good flexibility with mounting either on top of the fan or somewhere inside the case I decided to go with 14 millimeter hardline tubing so it is clear and if I use color coolant in the future it will pop nicely but we're lighting the system with hardware instead which is why we get the clear accel 5 coolant and this one bottle is enough to fill this entire loop if you lost pieces include this insane Ram kit the Dominator platinum RGB 128 gigabytes perfect for Chrome at 3000 megahertz so 16 gigabytes per dim they include coursers new Capelli's LEDs which are super bright and I'm told have awesome lighting effects I also have 2 MP 510 drives so 4 terabytes of envious storage in this system still can't believe that's happening and everything is powered by corsair ax 1000 a titanium efficiency fully modular PSU that completes this crazy Threadripper system so if you're after that brand loyalty yeah it's not that hard with Corsair now for the preparation the process includes installing everything onto the motherboard so like the RAM the nvme drives the CPU block then we can the mount the radiators inside the enclosure one the top one in the bottom mount the motherboard inside the case do all the cable management because that's the easiest way to organize everything then install the GPU block which I've never actually disassembled the graphics card in my life HP was surprised by that and so am I now realizing it and then do all the hard line tubing should be fun well the people the so weird Flags going on right now first of all I have never held such a heavy motherboard in my life we have all the RAM populated all the SSD this motherboard is by the way insanity value-wise we're close to three thousand dollars that's in my hands that's for 128 gigabytes of RAM that was 4 terabytes of nvme storage we have the waterblock and the malware itself and of course a 16 core 2950X but it's time to put this thing in the air hole I can't believe the power is done the cable management has begun so HP the bulk of the bill is complete the motherboards in the radiators are in now I have to mount my first-ever GPU block how excited that you I'm nervous no it'll be fine why are you nervous because of me I've seen how you handle my screwdriver so let's see how it's gonna go oh by the way don't forget your tweezers for cable management so the disassembly of my ear first GPU was a success this took no longer than 10 minutes very simple I'm thankful this is not a founder Edition card because I know those can be quite tricky and now I just have to put back the cooler together all the screws because that is a good practice when you water cooling so HP what's with the verdict how did I do perfect I don't see like any way that anything could have gone wrong here so it's pretty much time to get this thing into your case now before that doors in let me tell you about today's sponsor privacy calm it's a free service that creates virtual credit cards for online merchants like Amazon Netflix iTunes and others so your real credit and debit cards stay protected in case of breaches from online merchants setting up a card is no hassle at all with a handy span limit customization for each card so you don't worry about

privacy comm slash hwc to get the $5 credit on your first privacy purchase that is primary still calm / hwc alright I appreciate you watching this video thank you so much for coming along this journey please be patient with the part 2 that is coming up it's going to be super epic where we finish up the rest of the hardline tubing with the cable management and my experience of using this machine on a day to day basis for video production and wait till you see the temperatures I'm getting on the GPU when it's overclocked and this CPU as well it is mind blow a bomb well a little mind boggling I can't even say that word straight it is exactly what I wanted from the very beginning and actually exceeded my expectations to a whole new level and very happy with this upgrade thanks much for watching check out this other relevant content and yeah stay tuned for an epic part 2 coming soon",
