    "transcript": "ha it's always great to visit Phanteks know we have nice little welcome over here and well look like Eber is already here enjoying his time with what is this what are we looking at we are looking at the Phanteks Enthoo Luxe 2 it looks like they've made a bunch of new changes and the refinements on the locks - that we originally saw at CES so let's check this thing out and see exactly who this case is for but first thanks to Phanteks and SteelSeries for making our trip at Computex post about it alright so today let's talk about the Enthoo Luxe 2 we saw the original one at CES and now it's been refined and completed and they have done some changes to the enclosure that are important to mention and I think the overall direction is good and I like that there's focus with this enclosure it's not just like a case that can accommodate everything and you know you can buy a standard ATX motherboard and put a case put it inside the case here of course you can but the whole point of it is to utilize the size of the enclosure to your own advantage because if you're actually going for something a bit smaller there are other options available and I like that Phanteks in't afraid to give users exactly what this case is designed for so that means gamers who want an extreme system with water cooling and massive radiators everywhere that could be professionals who want something with more storage that means people who want dual system configurations with either an ATX motherboard or dual socket motherboard because the case accommodates that and a small ITX motherboard below it that means for people who want a really powerful system with dual power supplies so the case the interlocks do is quite flexible in that regard so the main changes when it comes to the physical characteristics of the case include they've removed the fabric that we saw at CES so that high airflow fabric that we see on P600's that looks amazing now has been removed to actually improve air flow because that was a restriction on the front panel and the top and they found that the airflow is better without it yet we still have this nice fine dust filter that is superfine therefore allows a lot of the air flow to percolate through while not allowing any dust to the exterior is sandblasted aluminum paneling for the front and the top panels while the actual frame itself is plastic so there is that dual material combination it doesn't look cheap but you might definitely feel the difference while handling the case as for the TG side panels they are on hinges and they can be secured with a thumb screw at the front so if your transport in case it won't simply fly open they also have magnets and a pins so that the the panel is nicely secured and there's no wiggle room when it is in transport so nice little thought put into making sure the tempered glass panel gets to where it needs to be without being broken as for the interior the whole modularity aspect is cool so aside from your standard motherboard area you can have an ITX motherboard right below it and you just have to pre install the motherboard standoffs and the actual ITX bracket is already included with the enclosure that is not sold separately however you do have to buy the riser cable separately and that whole bottom section because it's so tall you can do a 360 rad at the bottom when push-pull and the really thick radiators if that is your choice you can also mount hard drive cages in that slot and mount them for stacks which is awesome if you are going towards the hard drive route the side cover plates can be used for SSD mounting on both sides so you can show them off and you can also hide them in the back and the grooves allow for some cable management situations through the back and you can also remove them to install hard drive cages in there or remove them completely to have spacing for a 480 milna radiator so quad 120 mil rod so the whole airflow section is pretty unique so you can do 15 fans in total which is kind of insane if you're going for airflow or water cooling so you can do dual 480 Newman radiators at the same time Plus duo 360 mil radiators at the same time so that is a lot of water cooling equipment that you can fit in the case at the same time and speaking of water cooling we saw the glacier d1 40 which is a universal distribution plate that can be mounted on any case that supports 140 Miller rear exhaust fans and has seven PCIe slots which means that that vac can be occupied with more water cooling components it gives the the entire tubing a bit of a unique aesthetic and has multiple locations into which you can reroute the CPU area the GPU area the fill port and the exhaust port or the drain port as well and while I'm not really much into water cooling I feel like that whole direction of mounting something at the back of the case instead of a traditional fan or a radiator the back looks pretty awesome especially because it's transparent and it is illuminated that thing is $99 definitely fits the Luxe 2 aesthetic and what that is trying to achieve but also fits basically any other case that will have 140 ml fans and seven PCI slots there is a fan control included behind the case at the top nice position can support seven fans in total either of PWM control or SATA and the cool thing is the case actually does not come with any fans because with a enclosure that is that large and so flexible what they're trying to achieve is give users the customization of what they're trying to do without letting you waste any fans because normally you populate your own fans and not use the stock ones and this allow them to reduce the cost by about five bucks or so so the case is a hundred and eighty nine dollars which means that it still separates itself from the evolv X or the P600's enclosures and I would say that's a pretty competitive price point for a really hybrid chassis like the Luxe 2 as for the dual system configuration because of the bracket that gives you a chance to have two vertical GPU orientations that's pretty cool to showcase both them if you go that route and the front I of course can be split to power one system with a power button and power the other one with the reset button if you wish to do so and those dual USB 3s can be again split into each system and as for cable management at the back you can see they've kept the dual velcro channels and added a plate in front of the power supply that hides all that main cable exit and will basically just make it appear like a cleaner system from the back and that panel has appropriate spacings for the cables to exit and it's really awesome to see the Luxe 2 in action outside of having a simple empty chassis we also had a full production machine that was water-cooled with dual quadrille cards and the insane dual socket motherboard not necessarily sure I would water cool a system like it but it kind of shows you what is possible with hard drive support as well of course they had the full gaming setup with dual system configuration both the main ATX motherboard and the ITX motherboard a water-cooled and just gives you the options to think about what you could do I would say the Luxe 2 is not for everybody but if you're approaching the the route of wanting to go full extreme in either direction you can definitely have plenty of options to do so and so the case will be available in early August of this year for $189 which I would say is a competitive price point for a case of this caliber I'm ok and for them not including any fans because you most likely be using your own I don't like how they removed that high airflow fabric pieces from the front and the top I thought it looked better when the CES enclosure even though they said that performance is better without it and they are targeting towards the performance market what still looks pretty decent I just thought that the high airflow fabric added some nice unique character to the case but it still holds the true DNA of the original and the luxe in terms of that curved led soft ambient strip throughout the in case that is also found on the interior now to separate the power supply shroud and I really like what they've done with the design let me know what you think of the luck stew in the comments make sure to check out this other relevant content and thanks much for watching I'll talk to you in the next video",
