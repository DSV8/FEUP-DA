    "transcript": "hey what do you have an apple you snake so guys I have to admit I really love this notebook ever has one and now I have an even better one so welcome to my full experience with a Razer Blade 15 2019 advanced model this is the fully SPECT out three thousand dollar machine RTX 2080 there 16 gigabytes of dual channel RAM 512 gigabytes of nvme storage so you know we're gonna go over performance cooling my experience with the body 2 let's begin right after this the legendary hyper 212 CPU cooler from cooler master now comes in this breathtaking matte black finish the included Silencio 120 millimeter fan delivers great airflow and reduced noise plus you can pick up an RGB version of this cooler as well learn more about the hyper 212 Black Edition and its RGB sibling down below alright let's dive right in build quality is first I would equate this machine to be like a MacBook equivalent amongst Windows notebooks simply because that whole aluminium shell is very reminiscent of a MacBook but here we have that black color scheme instead of silver and no flexing anywhere the edges are super sharp thus the Razer Blade a name is fitting for this sort of body and compared to my recent experience with the MS ip65 that flexes anywhere you press it this machine does not and that makes me happy but the black aluminum shell while feeling great leaves finger marks all over the place on the exterior and on the interior since that is also fully aluminum so that's kind of unfortunate it is impressive with how thin the machine is considering it has an rtx 2080 maxq inside of it so portability factor is absolutely not an issue and as a desktop replacement specs wise it fits perfectly now your port selection is pretty rich with plenty of display connectivity and type-c Thunderbolt 3 which is awesome plus those green USBs and the combo mic slash headphone jack for headsets and gaming headphones however there is no Ethernet that you find on the base model instead of the advanced model and no SD card reader which is kind of unfortunate I also really dislike the new power connection because the cable is so thick now the thing is you can route it either facing the back or the side but if it's facing towards you it's blocking the most closest USB port which is design flaw and while the power brick self is pretty compact the cable itself isn't because it is so thick it kinks easily and just really really unpleasant to travel with now the keyboard is fantastic for anything but gaming because the travel distance is quite shallow so for typing it's excellent nice clicky actuations fast rebounds you know we can get used to that quite nicely but if your hand is constantly in that wast zone then you expect the key to travel a bit more into the body while gaming but it doesn't a slight quirk here would be the awkward error placement on the bottom right since you expect the question mark to be placed beside the shift but that is where your arrow key up is located instead but I love the lighting integration in here with perky lighting customization plenty of awesome effects I love the fire one and the keys are super bright and the secondary keys are now finally illuminated the trackpad here is quite large and is also fantastic just like the keyboard nice smooth navigation when there's precision drivers and is so much better than anything else I've tried on the Windows machine or Windows notebook aside from like the Dell options like my MSI p65 also has windows precision drivers but this thing is so much more responsive now the speakers are properly firing up with decent volume projection and clarity Nicholas I do enjoy the built-in windows hello feature here so we can just login when your face but it doesn't find me frequently whenever light changes it's like who you are you have to punch in your PIN so that's kind of unfortunate and the webcam is it's passive so this is the lovely 720p webcam quality wow it's terrible and just for comparison here's the iPhone 10s selfie mode much better and my favorite thing about the notebook is the display it's 144 Hertz so super fast and food for gaming but it's so much better for regular desktop use and while editing it is full HD so resolution is not a problem for the rtx 2080 maxq but for key option is only available with the -tx 2070 models so if you're going to fool out RTX 2080 max-q then you don't have a 4k option which is kind of strange but I don't miss 4k at fifteen point six inches full HD for me is plenty and so the gaming performance on the fully decked out the Razer Blade 15 is actually pretty fantastic given we have only full HD resolution so not that many pixels to push and the rtx 2080 max-q and in games where ray-tracing is available you know performance hit with RT enabled is pretty significant as it is on desktop cards so I wouldn't suggest getting you know in RTX 2080 to play bF5 with RTx on or DXR on and metro Exodus with RT on because the performance by itself is pretty fantastic but as long as the whole ray-tracing the--is scene is out of the picture now one major concern when it comes to the RTX max q variant and laptop variant GPUs inside these notebooks is that the boost clocks are solely dependent on the cooling which is solely dependent on the brand and so it's Razer's job to provide sufficient cooling for the GPU and the CPU to hit highest clocks possible and so the cooling in this machine is actually pretty fantastic my max Q card never went above 76 degrees Celsius at load and bf5 I was constantly hitting around 1600 megahertz for the boost clocks while in other games I was hovering around 40 100 megahertz so the cooling is dependent or the clocks are dependent on the cooling and the ceiling for that temperature is 76 degrees Celsius for the graphics card and as for the CPU the temperature was pretty consistent between 87 degrees Celsius and 89 degrees Celsius and constantly going between 2.5 gigahertz and 3.9 gigahertz so nice overclock on some course but not consistent 3.9 yoghurts throughout the entire session and it did vary depending on temperature and the scene and also of course this machine is fantastic for video production just look at those render times compared to my main workstation PC and the msi p65 so it's almost equivalent to what I get on my main 9900K and the 2080 Ti so for video production this thing is awesome now this notebook has three performance modes balanced gaming and creator and balancing gaming and they're pretty much identical in terms of powering now the GPU and the CPU about the same as you can see based on the fire strikes course but in the Creator mode it significantly throttles the GPU to 800 megahertz and channeling all that power to the CPU so it can maintain higher clocks so just keep that in mind as far now as levels the machine is dead silent and like casual operation but while I'm rendering or gaming the fans a spin up and especially if I max out the fan rpm 250 300 then yeah the Machine becomes pretty loud upgradability here is pretty straightforward remove the cover there we have the two RAM slots the top one is covered by the GPU ribbon cable so you have to be careful removing that and getting access to that top RAM slot and we also have that nvme SSD on the left side and that's for battery life with light usage browsing scenario I was able to get just over 4 hours of usage before the computer went to 5% and went to hibernation but this is with the screen at 75% brightness and 144 Hertz and so at $3,000 this machine is hella pricey given you can find the same CPU in a notebook that cost $800 but of course we have the RTX 2080 max Q in there the SSD and this whole build quality 144 Hertz display and the overall package seems to be very well complete I am especially impressed by the cooling capacity of that vapor chamber cooler for the GPU you know reaching 76 degrees Celsius and that is its throttle limit here while the CPU you know comfortably sits like you're just below 90 degrees but still clocking 23.9 quite regularly regularly I regularly and really my main point of frustration believe it or not would be the power plug cable that sounds ridiculous but why does it have to be that thick it kinks easily and really does not suit the overall like design that's been you know a thought process that been placed behind this machine and also the whole max-q boost clark's depending on the notebook manufacturer and luckily I think Razer has done a really good job here to maximize performance without too many compromises alright guys so that is my experience with the Razer Blade 15 this thing will definitely be travelling with me wherever I go because the performance in this form factor is simply amazing and yeah very happy to have this thing in my collection now for video production and also on-the-go gaming alright I'm to me dream thanks for watching we'll see you in the next video",
