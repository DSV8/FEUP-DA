    "transcript": "if you're watching this video in 2017 you know for a fact that smartphones have been receiving beautiful designs that just grab your attention right away this year has been a great start for smartphones and LG but the bullet a little earlier than expected by launching the g6 the successor to the not so well appraised g5 and they've strike back big-time now I'm pretty aware of the competition right now because the Samsung Galaxy s8 has been receiving a lot of fame for its design in just the way how it looks plus it has its own exclusive features that are samsung focused and as much as I would love to get my hands on one for the time being I've been using the g6 so I'm just going to talk about my experience for the past few weeks and so here's my full review but before that a quick message from our sponsor you you it's time to show off your elites I wouldn't make be okay so let's just get a few things clarified before I proceed to the review I've been using the Nexus 6p for the past few years now and I've never felt the need for an upgrade it has a beautiful q HD AMOLED screen excellent build and design along with a fantastic camera it gets me through the day just fine and I've always been a fan of the cleaner user experience with stock Android it has received numerous updates over time and currently it's rocking androids latest 7.1.1 OS but oddly enough the g6 hasn't passed 7.0 I mean really a two-year old phone versus a two month old phone anyways I swapped the sim from the six speed to the g6 booted it up and spent about 30 minutes downloading the apps and setting up to fit my style the first thing I noticed right away was the size of the g6 comparing them side by side you can see that the g6 has a much smaller footprint than the 6p yet it boasts the exact same 5.7 inch display that's crazy and look at those bezels it almost stands across the entire phone and I love it the top and bottom chin are symmetrical and check out these curved corners on that screen the attention to detail is just stunning and that goes for the overall build quality as well it's made out of metal and glass and structurally this thing is legit I'm actually more comfortable using this phone without a case than what I would do with the 6p so you see guys when you pick this up you'll feel premium quality all over the body and to me that's always a plus but it does come with its own caveats the rear side of the phone is covered in Gorilla Glass 5 which looks great especially with the brushed metal texture hidden underneath although this glass picks up smudges and grease easily which makes the phone uncomfort into hold at times a quick fix to this would obviously be applying a skin of some sort on the back of this phone but I wouldn't hear your thoughts about this do you prefer a glass back on a flagship smartphone compared to something like a matte black finish let us know the comments down below the g6 comes with an IP 68 water and dust resistant rating so that should prevent damage from accidental spills I respect elegy for including this feature because competitors have already adapted this since last year and I think it's safe to say that it is an expectation to see this implemented on every flagship device from now on oh and for those wondering the g6 comes with a headphone jack sadly the North American models don't come with the high performance quad 32-bit DAC found on the b20 but hey at least it included a headphone jack it's actually really good in fact it's miles better than the terrible one found on the 6p the g6 can drive my HD 5 minutes really well and I had my zone at moments so I'll just leave it at that along with the nano SIM card slot LG has also included a micro SD card slot that can be expanded up to 2 terabytes hold on 2 terabytes really can you find a card that exists with that capacity if you do it's probably gonna cost you a fortune but I'm glad LG has provided us with that storage expansion because once again North American models come with 32 gigabytes of on-board storage and I've already eaten up more than half the capacity over the course of two weeks it's something to keep in mind especially if you plan on using this phone for taking a lot of pictures or 4k video I took a while to get used to the button layout from the g6 the volume rockers are located at the top left side of the body whereas my Nexus 6p had all the buttons on the right side which organ amah Clee is the best cypher button placements to reach with your thumb in my opinion but thanks to the smaller size of the g6 activating any buttons on the left was simple with my index finger the power button is located at the back which also acts as a fingerprint reader and it's pretty fast and unlocking the device you can also double tap to wake up the screen if you're using the phone laid flat on a desk and there's no camera bumps whatsoever so you can comfortably use the device without experiencing unnecessary movement finally let's talk about that display I am still blown away by the fact that they were able to cram a 5.7 inch screen in such a compact form factor remember it boasts a 28 80 by 1440 resolution and if you were to do the math that equates to an 18 by 9 or 2 by 1 aspect ratio so here's what you need to know you're getting a slightly taller screen that gives you a lot more vertical real estate for multitasking if you use that feature on the downside you'll experience these black bars watching native 16 by 9 content honestly it's not a big deal for me personally I would have preferred an AMOLED or OLED panel because with that you'd be getting a lot more deeper blacks than what you'd be normally noticing with an IPS LCD screen that being said this is not a bad display I really enjoyed my time watching content and just using the phone on a regular basis I'll admit it took me a few days to get used to these slightly toned-down colors compared to the AMOLED screen on the 6p and a good example of that would be this picture I tweeted out just a few days into testing at first I thought that the colors were a bit washed out but a couple days later I noticed that they were just fine it's interesting how we percept colors differently especially when you switch screens and if you're watching this video on an AMOLED display it might look a lot more saturated when compared against an IPS LCD panel some other key features about this display is that it supports the Dolby vision standard that means you're getting better dynamic range brightness contrast so consuming content was a pleasant experience the colors look great but it all comes down to content availability the saturation level obviously does not stand up against an AMOLED display but that's subjective what do you guys think AMOLED or IPs let us know in the comments down below it's always hard to find a smart phone these days with front-facing speakers and the LG G6 follows the same trend now there's a single 1.2 driver at the bottom that's decent but not mind-blowing plus you can easily mute it with your fingers when you're using the phone in landscape mode and look compromises have to be made for integrating this large display and I understand that but if you care about front-facing speakers you should probably look elsewhere the software experience out of the box was not the best that I come across on an Android phone let me get this straight the g6 comes with Android 7.0 and on top of that LG has applied their own skin which in my eyes still needs improvement everything from the built-in keyboard to LG's proprietary apps takes up unnecessary space maybe I'm just being too silly but I wanted to replicate a similar and middlemost experience from my 6 feet so here's what I did install nova launcher and Google keyboard scale the display all the way down to its native resolution enabled the developer settings and reduce the animation scales to 0.5 X and man bell stampy right away LG has a theme strobe built-in I took advantage of the dark theme and it looks pretty awesome with my setup that's the beauty with Android the user has full control of the software experience customization is endless and thankfully the phone was fast even though it uses a slightly outdated Snapdragon 820 one chip I honestly don't care about high-end specs at this point because as long as the phone keeps up well with my tasks I'm happy this brings me to the next best thing about the LG G 6 the battery life look I'm a light user during weekdays because I spend most of my time in the studio editing scripting and filming products so casual usage gets me somewhere around 50 to 60% for the next day now I did spend a few days using the phone immensely catching up on a few TV shows on Netflix scripting a few reviews checking mail you name it and surprisingly the phone got me well over 6 hours of screen on time remember usage can vary from one person to the other but the g6 does a pretty good job holding up to that task even if you were to run out of juice this phone supports quick charge 3 bino and charges via taxi I applied to this phone with 10% left and once again thanks to quick charge this thing topped out at 50% in just 13 minutes that should get you through the day but don't forget this phone also supports wireless charging so there's that convenience so the last thing to cover here are the dual 13 megapixel cameras located at the back of the phone one of them is used for taking poachers both in daylight and low-light due to its F 1.8 aperture the other one features a hundred 25 degree wide angle lens and F 2.4 that means you can fit a lot more subjects in the shop without having to back yourself to readjust everything this is a really unique feature about the G 6 and I sure had a lot of fun testing both cameras before I get into the results I want to quickly mention LG's default crop factor out of the box the G6 has been set to take pictures at 8 point 7 megapixels this was done to take advantage of the 18 by 9 display but that crops a sensor and you lose a lot more detail with photos as you see I went back to the settings and enable the 4 by 3 option which takes advantage of the full 13 megapixels sensor and pictures I'm about to show you here were taken with that setting so let's start with the primary camera the pictures look really good to be honest dynamic range is excellent especially if you enable the HDR option and there were zero shutter lag when snapping these what's also interesting about the camera app is you have full manual control if you want to play around with the white balance shutter speed ISO and even options for manual focus with peaking seriously guys this takes mobile photography to the next level Albion when you zoom in a little bit you'll notice that the details are softer but if you're sharing pictures on social media this should be more than sufficient let's take a look at some samples it's time to take illumination seriously with vengeance RGB ddr4 memory by Corsair with incredibly bright LEDs and uniform color spread add a touch of classic color that is fully software controllable and compatible with a wide variety of intel and AMD platforms more info in the description below so my final verdict about the LG G6 is that I loved using it for the past few weeks everything from the build quality to the design to the gorgeous 5.7 inch display to the camera or cameras if I were to be more technical where awesome you really need to play around with the settings to get the best possible experience I did it and the difference was night and day and I still enjoy using it on a regular basis the battery life is amazing in fact it's probably one of the reasons why I'm switching over from a nexus 6p to the LG G 6 because I was averaging about three hours on the 6p and the g6 gets me well over 6 hours so that's double the time and so that's actually a plus for me and while I'm aware the camera needs a lot of improvement I'm pretty sure that LG can fix that with a software update and the last thing to discuss here is the price because the g6 starts at $650 and goes all the way up depending on what carrier you are at in the United States I think for the price you are getting a pretty decent package in fact I would wholeheartedly recommend this phone just because of the display the battery life and the design of the build quality it just is a premium device and I'm sure there are alternatives out there like the 1 plus 3t that costs a lot less than the g6 but you also have higher priced phones like the iPhone 7 or a galaxy s8 those are really expensive phones and they feature great designs but I guess it all comes down to user expense so I'm going to leave it right there and I want to know your thoughts about the LG G 6 what do you guys think about this phone the design the build quality to display leave a comment down below and let also let me know what the camera samples looked like and I guess that's pretty much it if you're interested in any alternatives plus if you're looking forward to that comparison between the galaxy s8 and this phone also make sure to leave a comment down below and i'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much for watching and we'll see you then one",
