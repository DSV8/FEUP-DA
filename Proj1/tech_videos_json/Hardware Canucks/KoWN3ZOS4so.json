    "transcript": "hello good people on three tree and today we're looking at best gaming headsets of 2019 we're ready sure but who needs a gaming headset anyway how often do you use a mic we will have alternatives for that crowd fine now this year was actually pretty decent for gaming audio many wireless releases as technology get better but let's remember none of these are perfect as usual headset as I was not expecting the cool master mh751 and mh752 to be that good they were launched in 2018 but only discovered by us in 2019 which is why I'm including them in this video they are among the most comfortable headsets to ever hit the gaming sector with minimal clamping force nice soft and deep ear cushions a light frame so you can wear them forever and the best sounding microphone for its price class this is what you get for $59 this is the most natural sounding value oriented gaming headset that I've ever heard there is no processing no compression with not too much bass in my vocals it's like it just sounds really good they're not bass heavy have wonderful clarity and the semi-open soundstage and since the mic is removable and they don't look ridiculous on your head it's a fine pair to wear in public too don't forget the 752 actually comes with the USB dongle for those on potatoe motherboards with ancient sound processing you're welcome oh I thought you were against gaming headsets that is right just looking for a perfect segue covering all the crap that launched this year okay so here's my collection of crap what happened with logitech g935 refresh brought back the outdated design pointless RGB that drains battery life a terrible loose volume wheel macro buttons on the headset I mean who thought this would be a good idea in 2019 that is actually a headset frame from 2015 exactly my point there so innovative hum the mic does not sound any good battery life is terrible but they do sound really amazing powerful clean output with one of the best surround sound nodes and if they can fix everything else about the headset but keep the drivers only then I would recommend the G900 Wireless for headsets but not until something actually good comes out Sennheiser is also on my crap list the GSP 670 it's way too expensive they really should ditch the terrible frame design that is bulky uncomfortable it looks ridiculous and it's also heavy because they have so much potential the wireless drivers are best-in-class with fantastic audio delivery a pretty decent microphone as well and powerful software suite that when it's not crashing it's actually pretty fun to use Sennheiser did launch the GSP 370 with a much more comfortable frame they sound amazing the microphone is not as good as the GSP 670 but they are almost half the price okay sure but the microphone is terrible good luck with the dongle I'm getting crackles and audio distortions the microphone disconnecting from both my AMD system and Intel the headset does not wake up on my AMD system which is bizarre and certain features like Mic sidetone and noise cancellation are actually disabled on the 370 come on alright so how about we bring up the Corsair virtuoso wireless RGB to make up for the whole Wireless Arena this is the headset with an impressive list of features first it's one of the only headsets with a type-c connector love it the mechanics of all the controls is wonderful smooth resistance on the volume wheel every moving microphone incredible build quality but they didn't get the memo on the glossy sides this is the best sounding wireless microphone total of the year but comfort wise this will not be for everyone the ear cushions are not very deep and my ears do make contact with that internal wall sound quality is possible for wireless pair but the resolution is just not on the same level as the GSP wireless line but at least I've had zero issues with the connectivity they didn't all crash my PC and they work fine out of the box the next category would be the best sound and this one easily goes to the HyperX cloud orbit s the reason for that is simple planar magnetic drivers that are extremely powerful deliver insanely satisfying deep bass hits very good detail definition and lots of options for 3d experiences using the built-in gyroscope this is one of the few headsets that I actually enjoy in surround mode the soundstage expansion is natural without losing the default layering and stair they plug in via type C which is bonus and you can also run them off a 3.5 millimeter input well don't forget there are $300 pretty expensive the microphone quality sucks for the price point the clamping force is too tight and this whole waves are next head tracking technology is just a gimmick I know but I'm about to redeem the entire gaming headset category with the best all-around gaming headset the fnatic react this is a definition of a proper barebones gaming headset with a solid build quality decent removable microphone excellent memory foam ear cushions for bass trapping and passive isolation and drivers are tuned for clarity and closed soundstage for best competitor advantage and hearing audio cues that actually matter it's a properly priced gaming headset that's not trying to add RGB ton of accessories software tuning replaceable ear cups etc etc and for $69 this is an easy recommendation alright sounds like a good headset but what about people who need all the accessories well for under $100 I would say the new Logitech G pro had said is a decent candidate they are built very well they are comfortable with proper here cushions all the cables are detachable and even have a USB dongle and large like really prides on their driver tuning with the most natural sound delivery and it's very good to my ears I will say don't fall for the G Pro X headset because you're just paying $30 more it's an identical headset with all the same accessories but you do get the pointless Blu voice functionality in the software that makes you mic sound worse you're welcome what you listen to now is that recorded with the G Pro X headset the latest from Logitech this is a $99 pair and I can sense there's some form of compression happening I don't know if it's happening on a higher end or on the lower end but it just doesn't sound as natural as the Cooler master pair alright but what would you recommend build your own we have so many microphone options the v-moda boom pro sounds incredible and fits into any removable 3.5 millimeter jack on the headphone so my shp9500 from philips is my recommendation for natural open sound and incredible microphone quality there are also many options from mod mics that attach literally to anything because of that magnetic clamp system so you can pop that whenever you need the calms and remove it whenever you just want to use your proper regular headphones okay so there you have it our best and worst gaming headsets of the year everything will be linked description below as usual thanks much for watching I'm Dimitri signing off with my evil twin you are walking I'll talk to you guys in the next video I am happy gaming",
