    "description": "The AMD Ryzen 7 4800U is a monster 8 core, 16 thread CPU that's meant for the thin and light notebook market.  Can Intel's Ice Lake Compete?  Probably not.  It could be that AMD will now dominate on the notebook side as well.   \n\nThanks to Razer, Thermaltake, be quiet! and Phanteks\n\nSubscribe ► https://bit.ly/SubHWC\n\nAs an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases. \n\nGear list (Available on Amazon): \nMain Camera (Dmitry) - https://geni.us/SONYA7III\nMain Lens (Dmitry) - https://geni.us/Tamron2875\nMain Camera (Eber) - https://geni.us/CanonEOS-R\nMain Lens (Eber) - https://geni.us/dLL\nMain 2nd Lens (Eber) - https://geni.us/Canon24-70MKII\nMain Camera Mic (D & E) - https://geni.us/RODEMIC\nCheap 4K Camera (Panasonic G7) - https://geni.us/24nm\nAwesome Slider - https://geni.us/1Hwt\nOur Shotgun Mic - https://geni.us/Sennheiser-MKE600\n----------------------------------------­--------------------\nOur full site: https://bit.ly/HardwareCanucks\nJoin Our Forums: https://bit.ly/HWC_Forums\n\nFollow us for more updates!\nTwitter https://bit.ly/HWC_Twitter\nFaceBook https://bit.ly/HWC_Facebook\nInstagram https://bit.ly/HWC_Instagram\n----------------------------------------­---------------\n#ryzen4000 #amdryzen4000 #ryzen4000laptop #hardwarecanucks",

    "transcript": "AMD hi there I'm looking at you we're all looking at you you know Intel's opening the door you just gotta walk right through it and don't screw up well that didn't take too long did it I mean AMD pretty much stole the show again here at CES 2020 by now I'm saying a whole new range of notebook processors that are supposed to go head-to-head against Intel's ice Lake and comet Lake offerings after seeing them dominate the desktop market with Zen to architecture on their rise in 3000 series processors AMD is bringing that architecture into the notebook space and this is super exciting news so let's see what they'll be cooking up to right after a quick message from our sponsors of CES 2020 the quiet fan text um I'll take and razor without them our show coverage would not have it possible alright so why is this announcement such a big deal well if you actually take a step back about a year ago AMD announced their synth + architecture into the notebook space and it's been around for a year in fact I did take a look at a notebook from Asus called the GA502 do it was an ROG notebook performance was really not that great compared to what Intel had on the notebook space and that was one of the biggest drawbacks of those Lampa processors but things are about to change in a really big way this is gonna be a full-court press with h-series processors for high performance gaming and new series for thin and light notebooks finally there's also an updated Pro Series for professionals who need additional security and more features for AMD it all starts by battling Ice Lake and comic Lake you on their home turf and that's where the Ryzen 4000 new series comes into play here's what you need to know the new CPUs are based on Zen 2 vs. the 3000 series is n + + are coming in configs with up to 8 cores and an insane 16 threads that's a massive improvement over the last generation but one thing you'll notice is while core counts are up the clock speeds are generally lower - unfortunately AMD isn't using Navi GPUs in fact they're back to RX Vega graphics with a more enhanced design that allows them to sustain higher clock speeds now those clock speeds were achieved by using less compute units and this was also done to save some die area with these changes TDP starts at just 15 watts but AMD partners can config that up to 25 watts that up to Beck is super important to remember as we dive deeper into the specs since the clock speeds you'll see our maximum based on the highest in ipconfig and not all systems will hit those let's start at the top with that eight cores sixteen threaded monster the Ryzen 7 4800 you it's clogged speeds are pretty low but this thing is all about throwing as many cores as possible into a thin and light notebook personally I'm thinking this CPU will be an awesome option for content creators moving down to the Ryzen 7 4700U and 4800U well things are a bit confusing the 4700U actually have simultaneous multithreading disabling on its eight cores and that might look like an audition but let me explain we've already seen physical cores always be fever chill once created by SMT so this approach will really help be forty seven hundred you compete against insults fork or a thread isolate and comment Lake models but what about the 4600U yeah six course 12 threads and essentially matches the 4800 speeds so it'll probably have slightly higher multi-core performance when all the threads should be loaded it's a really odd positioning but there should be a great Commet Lake i7 10710 you comment processor stupid Intel the six core Ryzen 5 f4500U and the four core Ryzen 5 4400U look really interesting as well especially since they also have SMT disabled so they're already having pretty big advantage over Intel's lower end CPUs actually when it comes to a perfect combination of price performance and battery life the 4500 you looks like the best choice on the market right now past adding more cores and upgraded graphics AMD has really focused on overall efficiency by adding support for lpddr4 X and generally lowering component power that should mean much better battery life and quieter operation for notebooks when it comes to performance it looks like ice Lake maybe in a bit of trouble guys especially since it looks like aim the beats the 1065 g7 my favorite processor of all time across the board even in single core considering what we've seen though commonly could provides better competition since it offers higher clock speeds and more core now it's the same story with more intensive abs and becoming really evident that ice lakes performance limitations are coming back to bite Intel in the but they're trying to get some positive press by announcing the ten nanometer plus tiger lake with XC graphics at CES but we're only expecting that at the end of 2020 now there's something really interesting with this slide and it's not about how AMD's pulling ahead in some games look at how close the gentlemen graphics an ice Lake have come to matching or even beating the updated Vega and some key games it makes me wonder how this chart will change once x/e hits the tiger lake CPUs moving on to the high-performance HCR CPUs and this lineup is much smaller the Ryzen 7 4800H and the Ryzen 5 4600H are basically the same CPUs as the 4800U and the 4600U but with much higher base blocks TVP has also been increased to a configurable 35 1 to 45 watts with those things in mind they'll offer much more performance than used series but the hardware specs are only half the story here the thing is they've also incorporated a new technology called smart shift this allows a system equipped with a navi based graphics and a new Ryzen 4000 series CPU to dynamically shift power to whatever it's used the most if it's either the CPU or the GPU as an example this could allow for much higher GPU clock speeds during gaming since it's being given a larger portion of the system power resources the same could be said for CP performance during rendering according to AMD this allowed them to achieve up to 10 percent higher in game frame rates and much higher CPU rendering speeds as well now on to performance and weight what indie we doing I mean you're much better than this you're comparing a 16 thread processor to intel's i7 9750 h where's the 16 thread 99 ATH K or the 99 ATH there's no need for stuff like this I mean come on guys that's everything that you need to know about AMD's 4000 series processors for the notebook space I can't wait to get them in the studio to do a full performance analysis compared them to Intel's isolate comic Lake and their mainstream offerings on the notebook arena and yeah let me know what you guys think about them are you excited about them in fact if you are looking for a new fan in line notebook or even a new gaming notebook are you excited I'm really curious to know the comments I'm Eber with Hardware Canucks thank you so much watching I'll see you in the next one",
