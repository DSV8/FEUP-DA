    "transcript": "I'm looking at something from Japan. #harambe This.. is a Head Massager. You're like \"Lew, what channel am i on right now?\" \"Because your blowing MY MIND!\" You might of thought you might be seeing the thingy. I didn't know that this thing existed *Loud Sneeze* I don't even know what, what is the name of the company? Does it even say? It just says Head Massager on it. Intelligent air pressure. High-Frequency Magnetic Field, Infrared Heating. Multi Frequency Vibration and Soothing Music. Holy smokes that's a lot of things in one. Now if you're like me. You spend a lot of time, you're on the computer. You get strained a little bit. Like Jack for example, this is him half of the day. Rubbing the eyes, rubbing the temples, STRESSED OUT! Get yourself something like this. And you keep it moving. And you find that relaxation, you find that inner peace. Because you deserve it. And the Japanese are here to help. Lets jump inside this box! There we go. whoo hoho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho hooo ohohohoho Has my life been forever changed? Can you look at that? Maybe it has been changed. There's headphones in here as well. The remote. Control over.. I don't know. Some various things, temperature. Method i guess of the massage type. And then music. Then your headphones also plug into here. Now looks like this thing is battery operated. This takes four double A's Ok so some adjustments can be made here for size. And you spin this. Get it to the right size. Woooo Very soft. To tighten it back up which way, Whoaoo Ok. WHAA! You can get a real nice fit on there. What do you guys think of that look right there? Can this whole Massager really run off of just four batteries. The future of all human relaxation here. Ohhhhhh ohhhhh Ohhhhhh Ohhhhhh myyy god. Its even got a banger on that, can you guys? WHOOO WHERE HAS THIS BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE! All of the uh, the stress! The anxiety! It's all gone. Three different songs. Different program for the.... I am being squeezed with real force off of these four double A batteries. It is, It's like a, guuur The neck The temples I never in my life ever experienced something like this. You can set a timer on it. Five, ten, fifteen minutes. And there's also the temerature control. Ohh man oh. Oh I just switched up the pattern. Now its got a vibe to it. Ohhhwowowowo You know even if you don't need the japanese bangers, the music.... Oooh I unplugged this, there's a speaker in it. You hear that. Now this is a daily routine. People are trying to talk to me, I'm out to a fine dinner, it's this. I'm in the movie theater, it's this. I'm editing videos, it's this. This on the top here, does the vibration. And this fills with air. Powerful air, that sort of squeezes you. Yes, i look like a crazy individual right now, but i don't care. Do i look like i care, do i look like i'm in heaven huh, you tell me. This was 160 bucks. 165 WORTH EVERY PENNY! I'M A NEW MAN! This is my new hat. Every video, get used to it. *Relax*",
