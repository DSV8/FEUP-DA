Adding a ridiculously expensive graphics card to a Macbook Pro. Let's see how this goes! Yes of course, if your intention is exclusively to game Windows is a far better solution than Mac. That said, using Boot Camp you could easily setup a Windows install on a Macbook Pro or other Mac.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nWATCH SOME MORE VIDEOS...\n\nThis Slime Could Be Good For Your Phone...\nhttps://youtu.be/aarsyus_dP0?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nA Message from Apple...\nhttps://youtu.be/UiaqBdzCcBA?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\n4 Unique Gadgets You Didn't Know Existed...\nhttps://youtu.be/65U9iYYMLjc?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThe World's Most Dangerous iPhone Case\nhttps://youtu.be/bfArLcysAIc?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nYou Wish You Got THIS For Christmas...\nhttps://youtu.be/AIyFyjdOamM?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThe Most Requested Smartphone I've NEVER Featured...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXTwf2qKJsA&index=1&list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nApple Is Deliberately Slowing Down Your iPhone\nhttps://youtu.be/KvrffRnxD6k?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nOnePlus 5T Limited Edition Unboxing + Easter Egg\nhttps://youtu.be/k9dsVWmEZn4?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nUnboxing Google Home Mini With Demar DeRozan!\nhttps://youtu.be/rKh6N79h-MQ?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThe Coolest Laptop You've Never Heard Of...\nhttps://youtu.be/pfMfW_6aaPE?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nYou've Never Seen A Mouse Do This...\nhttps://youtu.be/8nN9x8EmEF8?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nCould This Phone Be The New Bezel-Less Champ?\nhttps://youtu.be/yyi1WYMvvHs?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThe $12 Smart Watch - Does It Suck?\nhttps://youtu.be/OGfOmbzinc0?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nDON'T Buy The Batband, Unless...\nhttps://youtu.be/DlE4Q-Ti07Y?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThe Smartphone For Superheroes...\nhttps://youtu.be/FAz_nKQbTj0?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\n4 Unique iPhone Accessories\nhttps://youtu.be/uZgnXJz_9DM?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nUnlock Any MacBook Without The Password\nhttps://youtu.be/IPsUM48H4MY?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nDON'T Buy The iPhone X\nhttps://youtu.be/2fGXDFiFBhg?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThe Super Smartphone You've Never heard Of...\nhttps://youtu.be/HkdoOyIRCj4?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThis 3D Audio Experience Will Blow Your Mind (Wear Headphones)\nhttps://youtu.be/40r8JE7aVI8?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nHow LOUD Is The Razer Phone?

    "transcript": "This is going to be a fun one. Look at this, multiple components on the table. I'm undertaking a little project here today Well, we are This is a thing called the Mantis Experiment with the idea of an external graphics card on your Macbook Pro Anything that supports Thunderbolt 3 Its referred to as an eGPU An external graphics unit The reason you would hook something like this up to a laptop Is to get desktop grade Graphical performance On a system that can be mobile Razer, they have their own unit that you can add to their blade laptops Which kinda operates in a similar fashion But up until this point, they haven't been too many options for people on Mac Laptops There's a wide variance of mac books Some of them more powerful than others Some that can really benefit from a set up like this. This thing is not really meant to go with you anywhere Acts as a hub For not just your graphics But also some other important peripherals This is for the graphics card 3 USB 3's Ethernet cord, thunderbolt 3 Not just for data connectivity It also can provide the 87 watts of power that your macbook pro wants to charge This is a single cable set-up You simply detach that one cable Don't need to worry about a power brick or anything extra 2 more USB 3 ports So that's a total of 5 x USB ports on this thing So you can keep your peripherals connected to this now you don't have to worry about ports on the laptop itself now you probably noticed this amazing looking box over here Graphics cards always have the coolest looking boxes a VEGA 64 card These are the units that are going to ship in the iMac pro therefore these should work on the latest MAC software without any driver Will how much did I pay for this I think I paid like 600 bucks for maybe I'm going to show you how this thing works this side panel just pops off no screws just like that thee power supply unit that's for mounting either a 2.5 inch hard drive or a SSD And the SATA connector for that drive is located right over here now I've heard the fan can be it bit noisy for some of course you could swap that out and then you have your graphics card slot right here that's the Important spot some of you might not know but you can also install windows you can do a boot camp situation on a MAC book pro oooo look at that o my Jack attack even you love something like that three different display ports and a HDMI this thing will be for the graphical performance of your laptop Without being connected to an external monitor So we have the card installed over here now And then a single thunderbolt 3 cable which was included in the box Going to to this macbook pro here Now this one is running Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.1 There's a lot of talk about compatability issues with devices like this But on this version right here we got a prompt immediately saying \"External GPU detected, log out to begin using the external GPU\" It's charging up too So as of right now we are running off that desktop grade graphics rather than the internal graphics of this macbook pro Alright, so you may have noticed I've got a different laptop now I was using Will's and now I'm using mine A little bit of time has passed Because I've been playing with this thing, tweaking it a little bit I really wanted to place it on my desk And using it for a slightly more extended period before reporting back This Graphics Card setup that I have here Is about as native as you can get while running 10.13.2 This card right here The Vega 64 is very power hungry This is a 550 watt Power Supply In here how is that really going to work with this particular card This card can want more power than what that's capable of So I've actually gone ahead and ordered another power supply, an 800 watt power supply to deal with this. I'd reccomend going with the Vega 56 instead of the 64 It's a little less power hungry and therefore slightly more supported Anyhow, I've got geekbench up here on the display I can actually test each GPU independently to start off let's do the Intel HD Graphics 530 that's in my laptop. Here we go It's scoring 19,642 On the OpenCL score, MacBooks without discreet graphics, without their own AMD cards just the Intel graphics Are gonna benefit the most from a set up like this cus they're working with relatively weak graphics to begin with Next up we're gonna move to The AMD Radeon Pro 460 Let's see what this can do 48,251 alright now last up and the most exciting AMD Radeon HD Vega 10 XT prototype who cares what it's called Let's see what it can do Ok, Boom I've got as high as 170,000 on this particular score A huge improvement here with Desktop Grade Graphics And the reason why it will be meaningful for a lot of users. You want the portability of a Laptop with graphics performance of a Desktop This kinda gives you both Now there's a reason why think like this have become popular on systems like Razer and now through products like this one they're trying to bring a more universal approach not just for Windows computers but in this case on Mac as well This is still a bit finicky it's not completely supportive. You're doing this at the moment at your own risk There you have it, there's the mantis venus With An AMD Vega 64 working on a MacBook Pro I think it's pretty cool, and quite frankly it's destroying the figures my laptop can produce on it's own I'll have the details down in the description. Also let me know. Do you guys like this type of video? Did it get too technical? Or are you into it? Would you like to see more? Let me know with your thumb down below, and I'll catch ya in the next one",
