    "transcript": "- Forgot what I was gonna say. - [Cameraman] There's a script. - Gah! Way back before the RTX 3080 TI was released, leaks and rumors made it sound as if NVIDIA's new flagship card would arrive with 20 gigabytes of VRAM. The version we ended up with only had 12 gigabytes. But turns out that 20 gigabyte version did exist. So you can stop calling me crazy now, the dreams were real. - [Cameraman] All right. - You were in my room last night. (chuckles) After firmware describing the card showed up on TechPowerUp, a Russian YouTuber, whose name I will definitely not pronounce correctly, actually got his hands on a gigabyte version of a 20 gig RTX 3080 TI and barch- - [Cameraman] Barchmark. - He barchmarked it. And benchmarked its Ethereum mining power. Since it did not come with the same hash rate limiter as the rest of the new RTX 30 series cards did. And it did okay, hitting up to 100 megahashes per second. Nice. Although usually memory bandwidth matters more than memory capacity for mining. It seems like NVIDIA made a limited run of these cards before deciding the 3080 TI should have 12 gigabytes of VRAM. You know, to make them more affordable. - [Cameraman] For who? Elon Musk? - Apple has sent out invites for its annual fall event taking place next Tuesday, September 14th. It's called California Streaming. - [Cameraman] California dreaming. - California Streaming. Cupertino is broadly expected to reveal four versions of the iPhone 13, as in the 13, the 13 Mini, the 13 Pro, and the 13 Pro Max Plus Silver. Or, just joking. Whatever. As well as the new Apple Watch and most importantly, a new MagSafe charger. - [Cameraman] Woo. - Eh? But not for laptops. That would be dumb. Interestingly, fairly accurate and strikingly handsome Apple leaker Jon Prosser released renders for the iPhone 14, the same day, based on his typical shadowy leaker sources. And if they're accurate, next year's iPhone will look pretty bomb ass indeed. Are we allowed to say bomb ass on this channel? - [Cameraman] Sure, haha! - Heh, it's fly. With flat sides like the iPhone 4, a punch hole selfie camera, welcome to 2020 guys, and no rear camera bump at all. Ooh, now that's futuristic. What, does it have a headphone jack too? Crazy. We also have some exclusive leaked information we can share with you right now. The iPhone 14 will run Fortnite. Epic's agreement to buy Apple is already in place. - [Cameraman] Whoa. - Exciting stuff. - [Cameraman] You heard it here first, what a scoop! - We bow down to our 10 cent overlords. And El Salvador went through with its big plan to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in the country on Tuesday. Very bullish. But the historic moment was immediately undercut with protests. Glitches with the official Chivo crypto wallet app, and massive drops in the value of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. I wouldn't say massive, (indistinct). Ethereum's still up. Bitcoin went from around 50,000 US dollars to 42,000, before stabilizing around 45,000. The exact cause of the drop is unclear, but it may have been caused by existing financial institutions and crypto skeptics, who bought massive sums of the coin and then sold it right after this happened. Hey, maybe El Salvadorians were able to buy in low, though. - [Cameraman] Maybe. - Depends on the timing. - [Cameraman] We can hope. - We're all still early guys. It's okay. It seems like Monopoly man doesn't want you to be able to join the blockchain revolution. He wants you to keep buying all the 300 different versions of Monopoly that exist. And that's stupid, because you know what? I bought Surrey Monopoly and it sucked. The person who made it obviously didn't even live here. - [Cameraman] Like Surrey, BC Monopoly? - Yes! Total disappointment. Available at Walmart somehow. Now, it's time for the quick bits. Brought to you by Build Redux, the PC builder striving to bring PC gaming to the masses with no price markups. You'll pay the same price for components that you would pay if you bought them yourself, with just a flat $75 fee to have an expert build your PC for you. It's actually Linus. Just joking, it's not. Just select your budget, pick which games you want to run, see how they perform and let Redux take care of the rest. All builds come with a two year warranty, so click the link in the description and start creating your PC today. Yes. The quick bits have cometh. Yay, shall we rejoice? - [Cameraman] Yeet. - Yeet. ProtonMail, an email service known for prioritized privacy with end to end encryption is facing criticism after providing a user's IP address to Swiss authorities. This story's full of holes. Which ProtonMail says it was forced to do under Swiss law. You better watch it. Hey, what else they got chocolate? I don't know. The service says they normally don't log IPs, but began logging this user's IP after the Swiss request. ProtonMail suggest its users use the Tor browser to avoid situations like this, because the cops don't really care about your privacy. They might not even know what a proton is. - [Cameraman] And they all have Swiss army knives. - And you know what? If you ask me they're negatively charged. AKAB! Australia's high court has ruled that media companies will be legally liable for comments posted on their social media pages. A decision spurred by a juvenile detainee, claiming that comments on news stories about him were defamatory. Well, it turns out he can sue media outlets in Australia for failing to moderate bad behavior in their comments. So if you're gonna say something about this video, please spend at least an hour fact checking all your claims first. - [Cameraman] Or we will argue with you. - If you don't have anything nice to say, at least make sure it's not defamatory. - [Cameraman] Comment somewhere else. - A BBC report claims that the average amount of time a TikTok viewer watches video on the app has surpassed the same metric for YouTube viewers, indicating that the mobile focused video app is closing in on YouTube's web video dominance. - [Cameraman] No, why? - How is this possible? - [Cameraman] What? - YouTube still has more viewers and watch time overall, but appears the teens have made their choice. The wrong choice, and they'll pay for it. - [Cameraman] There's still time. - Tick tock tick tock tick tock. Microsoft is warning users about a vulnerability in Office programs. Hackers are currently exploiting a flaw that could allow them to download malware onto victims' PCs as soon as they open up a corrupted Microsoft Office file. And let's face it, that's all of them. What are you, wandering around the internet, downloading random Excel spreadsheets? Don't do it! Didn't your parents teach you anything? Charles, he could, she could be in that other room, just talking to a strange spreadsheet. - [Cameraman] You don't know what formulas are hidden in there! - And let's end today's episode with a story with no puns at all. Chinese company XPeng is apparently working on a unicorn robot intended to serve as an electronic steed for children. This is true. Power Wheels are out. Unicorn robots are in. Go my children, ride into the future. It sounds horribly dangerous and bad. - [Cameraman] I'm gonna buy one. - The horn comes off and it's a microphone, you can karaoke. Wanna hear more horrible things and bad jokes? Come back on Friday for more tech news. Some of it will be good, I am assured. - [Cameraman] No promises. - I've been assured.",
