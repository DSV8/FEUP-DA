    "transcript": "- A tech news a day, keeps industry-specific ignorance away. So it's too bad we only do three videos a week. You're screwed, I'm sorry. Large portion of the internet may have no longer work for those with phones running Android 7.1.1 or earlier. That's Android nougat for you, sweet tooths. Sweet teeth? I like to think of myself as a sweet teeth. - [John] My whole mouth! - The issue is that a security certificate used by many sites is set to expire next September. So older Android versions will no longer trust it. An issue that highlights, yet again, the issue of Android updates for non-Pixel phones. - [John] My phones have so much baggage. - Some older phones are locked out of updates entirely, while others are very slow to get new versions due to staggered rollouts. Of course you might be asking why anyone would be running an Android version that old. But apparently, nearly 34% of users on the Google Play Store use a version before 7.1. Thankfully, there's an easy fix and it's readily available for all effected users right now. It's called buying a new phone. - You, - [John] You. - You scrub! - [John] Scrubs! - Come on! Virgin's Hyperloop is a step closer to reality, as its first test with a human crew aboard reportedly went off in Nevada without a hitch. - Launch. (upbeat music) - The company's co-founder and Head Passenger Experience were the two Guinea pigs who were flung down a 500 meter human pipe, going 107 miles per hour. They've were turned into Guinea pigs. Although that sounds really fast, the system is actually capable of going 240 miles per hour. Though the speed for this test was limited, so the riders could be comfortable and avoid excessive acceleration and braking over such a short distance. I wonder if it was as loud as this sighs in the background. Although obviously 500 meters isn't very far, the company is expected to build another testing ground in West Virginia, which is expected to feature longer runs and not turn anyone into Guinea pigs. - [John] A country road. - Maybe in the future, it'll even be more appealing than flying. I love being stuck in a metal tube with a bunch of strangers. So think about how much better the experience would be, without windows, ooh. It's no surprise that websites that rely on advertising revenue don't particularly like it when people use ad blockers, with plenty of sites throwing up warnings denying you access unless you disable them. Well, now one major streaming service is taking a different approach, as Twitch is reportedly limiting stream resolutions to only 480p if it detects an ad-blocker. Many users of uBlock Origin, an extremely popular browser ad block extension, have confirmed that the service's usual max quality of 1080p at 60 frames per second is no longer available to them. Although some users have unsurprisingly found a way to bypass this restriction, it remains to be seen if this will end up being a permanent change, as Twitch's advertising policies have already drawn the ire of some of its viewers for doing things like injecting ads in the middle of a stream. We have no plans to do mid-roll ads on Tech Linked, however, except for this one! Today's quick bits are sponsored by the Corsair K100 RGB gaming keyboard. With cutting edge performance, style, durability, and customization options. It has a refined design with a tub aluminum frame, dynamic per key RGB lighting, and Corsair's 44 zone three sided light edge, - [John] Light edge. - Ooh, which gives you RGB around the keyboard itself. It's not on the keyboard, it's just in the air. And it's CHERRY MX SPEED SILVER RGB silver switches are guaranteed for a hundred million keystrokes. So check it out today at the links below. On to the quick bits! If you've used Google Photos on your phone lately, you might've noticed that a color pop feature that was previously available to everyone is now behind a paywall. - [John] Yeah, I lone that! - And, great news! The paid version gives additional editing options though, to photos without depth information. And it looks like it's being rolled into the company's Google One subscription service, which will set you back two bucks a month. Two bucks, no! - [John] For something I haven't heard of? - I'm sure this will go over very well with a user base that might already be cash strapped from a pandemic. In case it wasn't clear, John meant that as sarcasm. T-Mobile might not be the first name you think of when you hear the words \"home internet,\" but it's offering it's LTE-based alternative to cable and fiber in over 130 more cities. Primarily areas in the American Midwest. The heart of the country. LTE home internet was initially focused on rural areas with limited connectivity options. But it's not a bad idea for cities if the existing ISPs all suck. Who am I kidding? That's never happened before, right? (mumbling in background) Oh, I guess the Midwest isn't like the super rural part. We're Canadians. - [John] It's the mid. - Sits right in the Midwest. A general in the British Army has said in an interview that he thinks a full one fourth of the army will be robotic by the next decade. - [John] Only one quarter of their bodies? 100% of people with one arm. - There are no firm dates yet, but he wouldn't be surprised if robots saw frontline combat, especially as the UK has had problems recruiting enough soldiers. Hopefully, that rollout will happen without a hitch and we won't end up living in the Terminator franchise. My question is, is anybody asked the robots how they feel about this? - [John] Not even the robots wanna be in the Terminator franchise. (laughter) - (mumbling) movie podcast subscribed to that. After eight long years, Halo 4 will finally be released next week on PC, after beta testing ended this weekend. The game was originally released on Xbox 360 in 2012, and next week's release marks another step towards the entire main Halo series being playable on PC, with Halo 5 now being the only exception. Maybe we'll see that one in 2028? - [John] What's taking them so long? - No way before that, John. They're coming fast. - [John] Time to get my old gang back together. (laughter) Popping the word out, boys! - Time to recruit a squad of 13-year-olds to call other people's moms, bad names. And McDonald's is joining other food chains in introducing a plant-based meatless patty that it's fittingly calling, McPlant. That's horrible, that's so bad. McPlant, would you like to order a McPlant? The company is looking at putting it on everything from burgers to breakfast offerings, with test products rolling out in limited markets next year. Personally, I can't wait to shove a McPlant in my face, as I've already been eating McAnimal for years now. That's why it's funny. That's our show. Come back Wednesday for more tech news, with no soy protein filler. Unless it's this, these new soy protein stuff that's really good. - [John] They're not gonna have soy, probably dude. - They're not gonna have soy, John. - [John] P protein. - Come on, John. Get with the, - [John] P? - Don't you love that?",
