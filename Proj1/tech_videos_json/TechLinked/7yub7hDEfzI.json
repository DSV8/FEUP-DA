    "transcript": "- Oh, man. TFW you get to do the tech news again. Really gets me, like right here. - [Riley] Right in the feels. - Yeah. Microsoft originally described Windows 10 as the last version of Windows and that windows 10 was less of an operating system and more of a service. Well, that might've been a whole crock of (beep) because on the support page, Microsoft lists the retirement date of Windows 10 as October 14th, 2025. Now combine that with the YouTube video that the company just posted, a slo-fi remix and what is a slo-fi remix anyway? - [Riley] Music stuff. - Okay. Well, anyway, Startup sounds from existing windows versions that's exactly 11 minutes long. - Windows, I know, I'm about to get there, Riley. Stop ruining it for me. That and the June 24th event where they're planning to unveil the next generation of Windows is happening at exactly 11:00 AM Eastern time. See, you ruined my punchline. Okay. So basically Windows 11 is happening, right? And we're all victims. Sure. It's probably going to be less like jumping from XP to Vista and more like windows 10 with some different stuff but that won't put Microsoft's words back in their mouth. I may upgrade to Windows 11 but I'll be stallowing the whole time. - [Riley] Very upset. Very good but I don't like it. - No. Microsoft has also detailed its plans to revolutionize the X-Box experience by making it even easier to have it without ever touching a console. Microsoft is working with manufacturers to embed support for Xcloud game streaming directly onto the TV. And for people who can't just go out and buy a fancy new TV the company has confirmed that they're building an X-Box streaming stick that will let you use Xcloud on any display. No console required. That's pretty cool. If X-Box keeps expanding their streaming platforms, Stadium might actually be in trouble. Wait, was that a joke? - [Riley] I don't know. - All right. And Elon Musk unveiled the plaid edition of the Tesla model S which is apparently the fastest production car ever with the ability to go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 1.99 seconds. - [Riley] Played edition. - Played? It says plaid, it's a plaid car, Riley. What I want to know is if it's plaid on the outside or on the inside. - [Riley] Neither. - Oh, but the car is also getting buzz for another type of speed, it's infotainment system, which is reportedly based on AMD's previously unseen Navi 23 GPU, which gives the car PS5-level performance in games. Musk demoed Cyberpunk 2077, running on the car's dashboard display at 60 FPS, along with a Tesla brand controller. The Navi 23 GPU is expected to be the chip powering AMD's upcoming RX 6600. And you know, honestly, I'm really happy that Elon was able to buy up enough of these so rich people could ignore them instead of making them available for gamers everywhere. - [Riley] Yeah, they deserve 'em. - Yeah. I mean, trampling more people in line at Micro Center. That's what life is now. Just get used to it. - [Riley] Only the survive strong. Wait- - The strong survive, Riley. - Now it's time for Quick Bits brought to you by iFixit, maker of compact tool kits with all the essential bits you need to fix your electronics. From mini kits with 16 bits to full repair tool kits to help you start your own repair business. iFixit has got you covered, but maybe you have no idea what you're doing and that's okay. That's kind of true for all of us. And iFixit's over 70,000 repair manuals with photos and step-by-step instructions will help get you up to speed. In honor of Father's day, iFixit is giving you a chance to expand your reper-twayr, repair-tor, repair- repertoire. Yeah, sure. With $10 off purchases of $50 or more and free standard shipping with the code DADS2021 until June 20th. - [Riley] Dads? - Dads, yeah. So make your dad proud or be your own dad and go to ifixit.com/techlinked. I can't be my own dad. That doesn't work. Anyway, Quick Bits or what make the world go round. Don't quote me on that. That's not science-based. Tech YouTubers Hardware Unboxed have called out another company for trying to influence their editorial direction. After LG allegedly tried to pay them to write a favorable review of a monitor. To be fair, there was a few instances of things being lost in translation. Australians can be really hard to explain. - [Riley] Oh, what are you going on about? - What? EA is the latest game company to suffer a hack. With attackers reportedly making off with 780 gigabytes of data, including game tools for multiple EA titles and the source code for the frostbite engine which powers the Battlefield games. Well, at least this one didn't involve ransomware, I guess. I would hate to see EA give up some of their hard-earned loot-box money. All about enriching the rich, right? A while back, the European union forced Google to present users with alternative search engine options on Android. So Google complied by charging companies to peer in a list during setup. Smart, yeah. After the EU came at them again, Google has said they'll stop doing that now, claiming it was a pretty good plan. You got to admit. - [Riley] That's a quote. - Intel is reportedly offering to buy chip design startup SiFive for $2 billion. The smaller company specializes in making RISC-V design. Same basic architecture used in ARM processors. Could this be the common ground that makes Intel and ARM finally give each other a SiFive? - [Riley] Did you like that one? - I did. No I didn't, I'm sorry. And a bunch of games and game updates were announced at the opening live stream for the Summer Game Fest yesterday, including a full game spinoff of the Borderlands 2 DLC Tina tiny's, Tina tiny's? - [Riley] Tina tiny's? - Tiny Tina's. But the biggest news by far was the gameplay trailer for Elden Ring, the collaboration between FromSoftware and George R. R. Martin, who is looking for literally any excuse now to avoid finishing The Winds Of Winter. Got to say, Dark Souls 5 looks pretty the same though. - [Riley] Yup. - Very exciting. - [Riley] It's a Dark Souls game. - Very exciting. Too cool to continue. So, come back on Monday for more tech news which will technically be the 484th sequel of the original TechLinked. - [Riley] Wow. - What a saga. - [Riley] Move over Star Wars.",
