    "transcript": "- Thank you for coming. I wanted to talk to you about your familiarity with today's tech news. Frankly, it's been lacking. We're gonna have to catch you up. Let's begin. Wow! Nvidia is going to require laptop manufacturers to be more transparent about just what the heck they're puttin' in there. OEMs selling notebooks with RTX 30-series graphics chips now have to update their product pages to include clock speeds, power ratings, and Max-Q features like WhisperMode and Dynamic Boost. Those sound like Pokemon moves. I like it. Nvidia's move comes after a confusing news cycle that involved some people thinking Nvidia was killing the Max-Q brand, until Nvidia clarified that the brand would live on, just in a much less useful form that didn't tell consumers anything about which gaming laptop would pwn and which one would leave you embarrassed with no kills at all while the whole server laughed at your misfortune. (James laughs) That's them laughing. That's the sound. - [James] Ha ha! - Frames win games, guys, and it's a one-to-one correlation. Speaking of Frames, Apple's VR headset. It's not really... Frames refer to glasses. Can you refer to VR headsets as frames? - [James] Depends what they look like, baby. It's Apple, baby! It's Jazz! (James snapping fingers) - Whoa! Okay! Anyways, a report from The Information has corroborated some of the details leaked by Bloomberg last week and added a few more. The report claims that the headset will feature dual 8K displays and more than 12 exterior cameras for movement tracking. All of this would be powered by a new Apple Silicon chip more powerful than the M1 in the company's current-gen MacBooks. And the device would sell for 3,000 U.S. Benjamins. I learned my lesson! It's not Benjamins. It's Washingtons, is on the $1 bill. - Ah. - It just sounds way... It sounds way more lame. - [James] Have a washy-wash. - All right, I don't know about all this. 16K is a lot of pixels to push, although the report also claims Apple's figured out a special technique for foveated rendering that makes it possible. And it seems a bit far-fetched, but hey, we're also hearing that Apple will soon be starting production on a self-driving car in partnership with Hyundai, so maybe Apple's just having a mid-life crisis and goin' wild, you know? Who knows what they're gonna do? They're unpredictable. - [James] Wait a second. 8K times two is not 16K. - Well... (sighs) Moving on. And in other Apple news, the company's current frenemy Facebook has gotten some backup in its campaign against the anti-tracking feature coming to iOS 14. Snap, maker of Shapchat... - Ah? - And Unity... Unity Both told their investors that the feature, which will allow users to prevent apps from tracking them using a personalized ID code, could cause the two companies to lose revenue within Unity, pegging the shortfall at $30 million annually. But they also said that's just 3% of their annual revenue. - [James] Snapchat? They can't afford it. - (snickers) Not at all. They'll be too busy making frames. Spectacles. The Harvard Business Review doesn't feel bad either. Their analysis showed Facebook's claim that the average small business advertiser could lose 60% of their sales was based on manipulated data. What? Facebook would never do that! They organize all my events! I trust them. Despite the opposition, it looks like iOS' anti-tracking feature may be here to stay. According to Bloomberg, Google is looking into implementing a very similar feature in Android. Don't track me, bro. Now it's time for Quick Bits, brought to you by MANSCAPED, the man's groomin' company that doesn't want you to let nicks or cuts ruin your Valentine's Day. Their Perfect Package 3.0 features their awesome Lawn Mower 3.0 waterproof body trimmer and a whole lot of other goodies, like their new Refined cologne. It's hypoallergenic and has a super subtle yet enticing woodsy scent that's a perfect compliment to the scent in other MANSCAPED products, because men do stuff in the woods! We go out there and chop stuff! - Big saws! - Kill animals! So visit MANSCAPED.com or click the link down below and use promo code TECH for 20% off and free shipping. (James whistles cat call) It's time for Quick Bits, Quick Bits Sham-a-lam-a-lam-a Quick Bits! - [James] Yeah. - I liked it. Google Pixel phones now have the ability to measure users' respiratory rate by pointing their phone's camera at their face and chest so it can see you take breaths like the disgusting fleshy organism you are. - [James] It's all meat! All the way through! - Blegh! Pixels can also measure heart rate. You just have to place your finger on the phone's camera, thus ruining the thing Pixels are best at, which is taking photos. But what do you value more? Taking nice photos or not having a heart attack? - [James] Smell my finger? - I wish. An EEC listing has been spotted containing references to the currently unannounced AMD RX 6700 XT, which is expected to be a midrange card with 12 gigabytes of RAM for 1440p gaming. Why are we even reporting on this? You're not gonna be able to buy it. Do we live just to suffer? I feel like a fish in a tank where people are kinda bringing in interesting things and I'm just like... - [James] And they never clean the tank. - It's disgusting in here! Amazon is making a big deal about the amazing AI-powered camera system built into its new fleet of electric delivery vans at the same time that everyone else is getting concerned that Amazon will be driving around filming everything with said AI-powered camera system, including their drivers. If the drivers yawn they'll be told to pull over for 15 minutes, which they won't do because if they don't hit their quota they'll be whipped back at the factory by Jeff- - [James] I pee in this jug. - I love my job. Oh, it's not Jeff Bezos anymore, it's Andy Jassy. I forgot to mention. Activision has finally done something about the heinous amount of cheating going on in \"Call of Duty: Warzone\" by banning 60,000 accounts. The community has complained for months about the problem, but the studio appears to have finally given in after YouTuber Vikkstar quit the game over all the players who are blatantly hacking. Apparently the game has had secret anti-cheat software this whole time, but now it's being enhanced. You wanna see enhanced? Watch this 360 no-scope, bruh. (Riley imitates gun cocking) (Riley yelps) Can you put a gunshot? Can you put a... (machine gun fire popping) And Xiaomi's business model now apparently revolves around publishing videos about super-wacky hardware concepts like this phone with four curved waterfall displays and zero ports. - [James] Me waterfall! (Riley chuckles) - Every Xiaomi story's gonna be pirate stuff now. Yarr! Me waterfall! Don't go chasin' 'em! It's not a real phone yet, but is a real video, and that's what's awesome. Thanks, Xiaomi, for making me believe in nothing again. And I have nothing more to say, so this video's over. Come back on Monday for more tech news, 'cause there's gonna be some. There's always some.",
