    "transcript": "- Oh, hello there. What's that? You'd like some tech news? Okay. Oh, I should... I should give it to you, right? I should give to you some. Oh, right, okay. Yep, um... Just a sec. Where's the tech news? EA has surprised no one with addition of full-screen ads that run during gameplay in \"UFC 4\". A Reddit post went viral this weekend, showing an ad for \"The Boys\" on Amazon Prime, \"The Boys\" popping up before and after replays during an in-game match. This is particularly annoying because EA has apparently added the promos after the game's launch, so players who thought they'd paid 60 bucks for the privilege of not being advertised to in-game were proven to be fools! Ah! Happens to me all the time. EA has responded to the backlash by apologizing for the ads, removing them from the game and promising they won't do it again. (chuckling) Sure. But it does make you ask the question: is EA wrong to try and recoup some of their investment by selling ads in a game? Sony, for example, apparently makes more money from DLC and microtransactions than anything else, partially thanks to the 30% cut that they take from all purchases on the PlayStation platform. Maybe if that cut was reduced, developers like EA would have more income and they wouldn't feel the need to put in stupid ads like this. Like, other developers might feel that way. EA would still do it. Speaking of people who wanna cut down a 30% cut, Epic Games! Yep, they've now filed for a court order that would force Apple to reinstate \"Fortnite\" onto the App Store while the two companies await a judgment on Epic's lawsuit. In case you've been living under a rock, after Epic broke the App Store guidelines by adding a direct payment option to \"Fortnite\", Apple removed the game from the App Store and later terminated Epic's developer account. But a judge didn't make Apple reinstate the game, saying the current situation doesn't actually harm Epic and the whole thing is kinda their fault anyways, which it totally is, to be fair. Well, with this latest filing, Epic is making the case that they are being harmed, saying the number of daily active \"Fortnite\" players on iOS has declined by over 60% since the game's removal, and that iOS players make up a third of the total \"Fortnite\" player base. Meanwhile, Google has made a statement trying to differentiate Epic's lawsuit against them from the one against Apple, claiming they do allow multiple app stores and even the sideloading of apps. We'll have to see what happens when the Apple case gets a hearing on September 28th. Hopefully Dennis will still be able to keep buying his favorite \"Fortnite\" dances on this iPhone. And the hype for NVIDIA's RTX 3000 series has reached a high. Now people are starting to ask, \"Wait a second, were we victims (ominous music) of marketing?\" NVIDIA said that the RTX 3080 is twice as fast as the RTX 2080, but leaked benchmarks indicate the card is only 168% faster than the 2080 Super. Now, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, it's the Super, not the vanilla 2080, and the benchmarks are compute-oriented, not gaming ones, but listen: there's still reason to be cautious. A source from an unnamed manufacturer reportedly told Coreteks that AMD was prepping a $599 card with performance between the 3070 and 3080, but might change that to $549 to undercut the RTX 3080, a similar strategy they employed with the RX 5000 series cards. And then you got all these leaks concerning a RTX 3070 Ti or 3070 Super, so all I'm saying is seems like there'll be a buncha developments in this whole next-gen GPU launch saga, so maybe just, you know, just wait a bit, you know? Just see what happens. Is that too much? Is that too much to ask for? Some patience, Dennis? And now from a word from Linus. Can't escape. - Now it's time for the Bat Qwats, brought to you by the Rampow 61-watt USB-C fast charger. This is just your grandma's all-in-one charging solution, it's a one-for-all, you know, kinda like the Musketeers, because you just need one charger for all your devices, from MacBooks to smart watches. It uses gallium nitride and power integration technology which keeps the charger cool, adjusts power output and maximizes charging efficiency, and it also allows Rampow to make this charger 48% smaller than the standard MacBook Pro charger for ultimate portability. It can also charge the MacBook Pro up to 50% in just 30 minutes, so use our offer code and the link below to get 35% off on Amazon. - You want some Quick Bits now? Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you, I got you, I got you. Microsoft has announced they're releasing the DirectStorage API, which is the same framework used to develop the Velocity Architecture in the Xbox Series X, allowing direct access to storage for reduced load time and more detailed game worlds. Between that and a recent leak pointing to a $599 price point for the Series X, oof, it looks more and more like the real pro gamer move is to get on PC. But hey, hey! Hey! I'm not judging, you know? There's so many flavors of Doritos and Mountain Dew, it's enticing, I get it. The Oculus Quest, or should I say Facebook's Oculus Quest, is being delisted from retail stores, no doubt in preparation for the announcement/launch of the standalone VR headset's successor. Will it even be called the Oculus Quest 2? Or just the Facebook Quest 2, since Oculus has basically been renamed to Facebook Reality Labs? Well, tune in on September 16th for the press conference, and we'll all be disappointed together. China claims they've landed that mysterious reusable spacecraft the country launched last week. No idea what it looks like, but we do kinda know what the rocket that launched it looks like because a part of it fell to the Earth extremely close to a populated village, as seen in video posted on Weibo, and this isn't even the first time it's happened. (sighs) Well. You know these made-in-China rockets: they're cheap, you know, but they get the job done. What's a village or two? You know? We put a thing in the sky. You can now emulate the Nintendo Switch on Android, but you have to buy these weird, sketchy controllers to do it. The Egg NS emulator claims it's made by people in the U.S., but it's pretty clear it's not. Look, if you wanna check this out, fine, but also, don't. And hey, it's 2020 and the world is goin' to hell, so it's only appropriate to fight hordes of demons in \"Doom\" by playing it on a pregnancy test. Yep, programmer Foone Turing posted a different kind of test result on Twitter. If you're willing to make the modifications yourself, playing on a 128x32-pixel monochrome display might be fun. Just don't pee on it. (laughs heartily) And that's it for this one, guys. Come back on Wednesday for more tech news, if that's... Is that what... Is that what you... Is that why you... Why do you watch this show? Is it about... Is it the tech news?",
