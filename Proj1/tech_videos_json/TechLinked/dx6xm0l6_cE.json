    "transcript": "- Daddy's home! That's right, I'm back from pat leave. - What? - Because I hate my family. - [Riley] Aw, don't call yourself \"Daddy.\" That's... - I like working. - You're right in front of me. - Intel's been going on a bit of a promo tour for their Arc graphics cards. They even waltzed onto our set uninvited on Friday. Very rude. So maybe it's not exactly a coincidence that a presentation slide listing prices and performance tiers for the whole lineup of Intel GPUs has strategically leaked. The slide indicates you'll be paying fewer than 400 US dollars for Intel's flagship A770. It'll compete with the RTX 3060 Ti and the Radeon 6650 XT, so \"flagship\" might be stretching it a little. Just below the A770 sits the A750, which looks like it'll go toe-to-toe with the 3060 and 6600 at slightly lower cost. Assuming that this slide is true, which you should probably not do, but we will, for fun, Intel may be compensating for the disappointing benchmarks we've seen so far by actually choosing reasonable prices- - What! - For their cards. - [Riley] Huh? - It's enough to make a gamer wanna see an Arc A870! But Intel has shot down rumors that a higher-end card that would compete in the enthusiast market would exist. Not because they can't make it, of course. - Oh, yeah. - They don't want to. They just don't feel like it. Stop being so pushy. - Leave me alone. - Just chill. Mostly pretty reliable Apple leaker Mark Gurman has said that new MacBook Pros featuring Apple's new M2 chip are in the works, and unlike the currently available 13-inch MacBook Pro, they might actually be worth buying. - [Riley] Oh! - Wow! - Got 'em! - One will be a 14-inch model while the other will have a 16-inch display, and while it sounds like we shouldn't expect much in terms of different design or outward features, Apple appears to be hoping the new M2 Pro and M2 Max variants will be enough to entice prospective buyers. If you bought one last year, upgrade already, because otherwise it's just... It's like the same laptop. And not only that, but we could also be getting a new Mac Pro with an M2 Extreme Extreme! - Oh! - Is that real? - Yeah! - There was no M1 Extreme. It went M1, then M1 Pro, Max, and Ultra, which was two M1 Maxes put together, uh... So what's an Extreme? - [Riley] It's folded into a paper airplane. - Everyone's talking about the images from the James Webb Telescope, and with how detailed they are, you might think it has a crap-ton of onboard storage. But according to a new IEEE report, it only has 68-gigabyte SSD? Which is smaller than what's probably sitting in your computer or phone right now. - [Riley] Oh, don't assume. I'm a minimalist. - You're so much better than this stupid satellite that's named after a different James. But NASA chose this storage system because it was specifically designed to withstand the rigors of space, which are so rigorous, and given that it sends all the data back to Earth once a day using a satellite band connection, it actually doesn't need a ton of storage. Is this TechLinked or Techquickie? One thing to keep an eye on though is that NASA expects the capacity to fall to 60 gigabytes in 10 years due to both drive wear and the impact of space radiation. So rigorous! Hopefully the drive trim enabled. - [Riley] And hopefully it gained some superpowers from that cosmic... Like the Fantastic Four. - Ah, yeah, yeah. - Did you see... - John Krasans... His, Kris... Zit... (beep) Now it's time for the Quick Bits, brought to you by Secret Lab, maker of chairs engineered to keep you incredibly comfortable for long hours at work and play or both at the same time. You can do that? If you're an esports player. - Ah! - [James] Their new Titan Evo 2022 chair will make you forget all about the question of whether playing video games is actually work or not work because of their amazing four-way lumbar support, ultra comfortable line of different seat materials, and up to a five-year extended warranty and 49-day return policy. You could almost use it for your whole esports career and then return it after. - Bam! - When you're 26. - Yeah. - Head to the link in the description and check out Secret Lab today. Quick Bits are just one way of connecting to the great cosmic mystery of tech news. There are other ways, but they're unnatural. (sinister music) In the ever-spinning rumor mill regarding the RTX 4000 series, we've got another one for you. It's now being claimed by a leaker that the only card we might see before the end of the year is the RTX 4090, while everything further down the product stack will be delayed until '23. The delay is likely being caused by oversupply of current-gen GPUs, in a natural systemic process that occurs without any human intervention that may or may not make Nvidia more money. - [Riley] Nothing we can do. - Hey, at least you can buy something. - That's true. - Huh? The chair of the FCC wants to increase America's broadband standard to 100 megabits down and 20 up from the current mark, which is 20 down and 3 up. Pretty ambitious for a chair. The old standard has been in place since early 2015, and growth in both overall data usage and work from home has caught the FCC's eye. If the standard is increased, the FCC can take more action to promote deployment, but current political deadlock makes it unclear when that will ever happen. - [Riley] Oh! - This could've been a statement about any policy change ever. - [Riley] Usually they get so much done. - Yeah. Speaking of politics, two US representatives have asked the Federal Trade Commission... That's the FTC, Riley. - Ah, got it. - To take harder action against VPN services that misrepresent how well they protect user privacy. Their concerns revolve not just around deceptive advertising but also that it's currently challenging to audit any claims VPNs make. But it's not clear if or when the FTC will actually do anything about it. Again, broadly applicable. - [Riley] I mean, it's like the VPNs are in office. - Instagram has rolled out a feature allowing users to make purchases from chats. The idea is that you can ping an account with any questions about products, and if you wanna buy, check out directly inside the conversation, baby. Don't add cart, add to chat. Coincidentally, I've also set up all my normal conversations with my friends this way. Insert coin to check my availability for pub night. - [Riley] Are you available? - And the mechanical hard drive continues to get pushed out of the market as only 45 million drives were shipped in the second quarter of this year. And while that sounds like a lot of drives, it's 33% fewer than last year. Wow! Repeating, of course. Although it isn't likely that the hard drive will disappear completely anytime soon, it could get pretty close. So hold your spinners tight. Savor these moments. Something else. - And that's the end. - And you get to savor tech news again on Wednesday, but for today, you must stop savoring. - Ah! - Swallow it already, dammit. - [Riley] Oh no, I already savored.",
