    "transcript": "- I don't always discuss the tech news, but when I do, I prefer the WAN Show. This was supposed to be Linus. Linus was supposed to host. And so then it was- (sighs) Android 13 is now available for Pixel Phones and many users who have updated are enjoying the new features like the removal of wireless charging. Yeah, users from multiple Reddit threads are reporting that wireless charging got borked on a number of Pixel models after updating to Android 13. Although it looks like the Pixel 4 is most affected. Other Pixel owners have also reported that RCS, the rich chat features standard that Google really wants Apple to support has stopped working on Google's own Fi mobile network. Of course, launch bugs aren't anything new, but what really sucks for owners of Pixel 6 series phones is that Google has disabled their ability to roll back to Android 12 due to a bootloader vulnerability. So now, they're stuck. Hey, look in the bright side, as long as you're on the cutting edge, you might get to try Google's upcoming Pixel face and fingerprint unlock feature, which will make up for the fact that on Pixels, those two things suck by themselves. But if you make users do both at the same time, they'll probably suck even more. So I don't really, I don't get it either. AMD's Ryzen processors have enjoyed a slight advantage over team blue's offerings for a while when it comes to productivity at least, but a new leak is making it look like Intel's Raptor Lake is going to hit the market claws first. That's my favorite high-dive technique into Raptor Lake. Chinese tech influencer, Extreme Player, has posted alleged specs of 14 Raptor Lake CPUs. While we've seen these numbers for the higher-end chips before, we haven't yet seen specs for the mid-range Core i5 chips, most of which are listed with six power and eight efficiency cores. The other notable detail here is all K Series processors appear to have two times more efficiency cores as their Alder Lake counterparts. It looks like Intel is done seeding the productivity crown to AMD, old Pat may seem like a nice guy, but who knows what ferocity hides under that warm smile. He hates doctors. Watch out, Lisa. And Mark Zuckerberg has responded to memes mocking the metaverse selfie he posted last week, which looked like it was taken from inside the Wii's main menu. According to poor Zuck, the photo was meant to celebrate the launch of Meta's Horizon Worlds in more countries. So we didn't have time to make it look like something other than a blank slate Roblox template. Mark posted another photo, showing what Horizon would look like after planned graphical upgrades rolled out and sure, you know, it looks slightly better, but even though I just used Roblox as an example of bad graphics, that company's metaverse ambitions involve making Roblox indistinguishable from the real world, both in terms of graphics and mechanics. I mean, they're already ahead of Meta and the avatars having legs department, so that's progress. Now, it's time for Quick Bits brought to you by Wondershare Filmora, the free to try video editing software with powerful yet intuitive functions. So anyone can edit even your dog. That's not a good idea, don't do that. But humans, yes. Filmora has tons of features like speed ramping and auto denoise. Plus there's tons of built-in templates, including texts, overlays and filters to help you get that perfect look quickly. There's options for subscription and lifetime licenses or you can download and try Filmora for free right now at the link in the description. Quick bits, if you can't beat them, just go home, do not attempt to join them. Things will end badly. China has been forced to shut down major factories in the country's manufacturing hub of Sichuan. I'm not saying that right, for almost a week due to temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius the region is struggling with the strongest heat wave seen in six decades leading to a dangerous amount of stress being placed on the electric grid as everybody pumps up the air conditioning. The shutdowns aren't great news for the still recovering global supply chain, but at least factory workers can take a break. Those last four hours are way harder than the previous eight, even with AC. Lenovo has issued a cease and desist to fellow laptop maker Framework over the latter company's power button design on their standalone motherboard chassis. The button resembles the logo for Lenovo's Legion gaming sub brand and frankly, I think it was intentional. It's a good thing Lenovo took action. Otherwise, someone might see that button and think, did Lenovo put that button there? Super Smash alike fighting game, MultiVersus has enjoyed mod support during its early access beta. But now that the game is out, publisher Warner Bros., has prevented the game from launching if any mods are installed. Yeah, the games director confirmed this which is crushing news to members of the community who have created tons of alternate skins, backgrounds, and music for the game. Although as expected, some of the mods can get weird. I can see why Warner Bros., might not want a duct taped Velma skin in there. Speaking of skin, researchers at MIT have developed an electronic skin that can wirelessly transmit sensor data, such as your pulse, sweat levels, and UV exposure all without the need for bulky chips. The team calls the technology E-skin and has not commented on whether they want people to replace their entire epidermis with this stuff, is that an option? I mean just, no more acne. And Embracer Group, the holding company gobbling up every gaming studio it can, has acquired the rights to the Lord of the Rings franchise. The purchase won't affect upcoming Lord of the Rings media like Amazon's \"The Rings of Power\" or Warner Brothers, \"The War of the Rohirrim\" because all LOTR media up to now, has been licensed anyway. Embracer says they may use the franchise rights to make cool new entries that everyone has been waiting to see like an origin story movie for Gandalf. I wanna see what it was like for the Maiar to grow up as primordial spirits when Iluvatar shaped the world. They'll be cool. And I know you wanna see more tech news. So come back on Monday for more, or, you know, I wrote just watch the WAN Show, you could do that. It would hurt my feelings.",
