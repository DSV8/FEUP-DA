    "transcript": "- How do you want me to deliver this, Riley, 'cause this intro seems really sexual? - [Riley] Whoa, that's you reading into it, man. That's not- - Come on, baby. - [Riley] Whoa! - Let's get our tech news on. - Alex, please. - Nvidia's RTX 3080 is still in very short supply, but that might be for the best because many users have been reporting the card randomly crashing during gameplay. An investigation revealed the problem is caused by capacitors on some factory overclocked cards from add-in board partners, and not a vengeful ghost sent by Lisa Su. It appears once the GPU's boost clock gets above about two gigahertz, it can overload the capacitors, causing a crash. After their part was initially posted on a hardware site, EVGA said they were indeed having problems with certain capacitors during testing. Limiting the boost clock manually seems to solve the issue, but it's certainly disappointing for those who plunked down extra cash for an overclocked card. It's not like a capacitor issue can be solved with a software update or something like that. Too bad it's not vengeful ghosts. You can get rid of those easily. - [Riley] Oh yeah, there's a couple of eye of newt. - Because ghosts don't exist. Speaking of random crashes, Apple Watch Series 3s are also being haunted, not by ghost but by watchOS 7. The new OS was released last week and brought a lot of new features to the Series 3, one of which causes the gadget to reboot several times a day without warning. Wait, that's a bug, not really a feature. Other users have complained of lag, which of course, can happen sometimes when old device gets new OSs. That's more demanding on the hardware, but it also raises the question of why Apple would even bother pushing WatchOS 7 to an older device that can't really run it. That definitely doesn't seem like something Apple would do. That was sarcasm. (Riley laughs) we're still (chuckles), an update though ended last week was supposed to fix the issue, but the users reported that the patch was ineffective, almost as if Apple wants you to buy the new watch SE for some mysterious unexplained reason. - [Riley] That's so unlike Apple. They love us. - Just get a Casio, works everyday. - Oh jeez. - If you're living in the U.S., and you use cryptocurrency at all, keep an eye out on your tax forms beginning in January. The IRS is reportedly thinking of adding a question on Form 1040, asking if you have any dealings with crypto during the last calendar year. And if so, how many hacker XP points you gained. - [Riley] That's not true. - Unsurprisingly, the tax authority have had a hard time tracking cryptocurrency transactions and determining whether people are using it to hide assets. They've already gotten their hands on records from cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase, but it's difficult to actually find the individuals behind each transaction, which I think is kind of the whole idea. (Riley laughs) - Except in that one reply all episode where everybody was like (blows raspberries), and found it. - Oh, that's true. - But, yeah. With this new proposal, filers would have to consciously check yes or no, which would theoretically make it easier for the feds to nail people for lying about bitcoin, but I'm sure cryptocurrency users will be fine. Just use incognito. That's not good advice. - Yeah, there's a tech tip. - Don't do that. - There's a tech tip for 'ya. - Today's quick bits are brought to you by Private Internet Access VPN, which lets you match your IP and encrypt your traffic. PIA offers 12,000 servers in 74 countries with no banned width caps. It has configural encryption levels with a kill switch to make you in control, and when combined with private browse, it can make websites think you're in a different country. You can connect up to five devices at once, whether it'd be Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, or Linux, and PIA's MACE feature, blocks malware and tracking domains. Try out the link below with a 30-day money-back guarantee. Is this sexual again, Riley? - [Riley] No, it's just- - Let's get our quick bits on. - [Riley] Stop saying it like that. - Hey, quick bits. (chuckles) A last minute ruling from a judge has saved TikTok from the ban hammer that was supposed to go into effect midnight last night. TikTok will now get an extension 'til the 12th of November to come to a sort of agreement with the U.S. administration In what fast is becoming a monthly tradition that may not continue depending on how the election goes. Well either way, it's been fun. Amazon's annual Prime Day event will be held on October 13th and 14th. Typically, Prime Day happens during summertime, but due to the pandemic, it was postponed, and there was some speculation that there wasn't going to be a 2020 Prime Day. - [Riley] Oh my God. - But now you're able to blow all your money on all sorts of crap that you don't really need just in time for the holidays, that magical time of the year when we really celebrate the birth of capitalism. If you're living in the U.K., you might be pleased to know that Uber will be operating once again in London, at least for the next year and a half. The Richter Company lost its operating license last year due to the concerns about unauthorized driver, which sounds like it could be the backbone of the plot for the next James Bond movie. - [Riley] He didn't have a license, Bond. You're grounded! - NASA still has plans to sent a multi-rotor drone to Saturn's moon, Titan, which is notable for being the only moon in the solar system with an atmosphere. However, the launch has now been delayed to 2027 partly because of the pandemic's impact on NASA's budget. The agency hopes to study the possibility that Titan might be habitable one day. And given how this year has gone, getting away from earth for a bit sounds like a pretty sweet deal. Take me away - And it's the end of the era for people who game on Facebook as FarmVille will be shutting down, Riley, (trumpet toots) At the end of this year. - [Riley] You can't stop me. The game has an 11-year run that was notable for spamming Facebook timelines with posts about how quickly your pig, or whatever was leveling up. The company behind FarmVille stated the end of Adobe Flash support as a key reason for the game being sunsetted. So I guess I'll have to try my head at real farming now, or just go play some Stardew Valley. - [Riley] You already do that. - Yeah, I play lots of Stardew, it's awesome. - [Riley] It's okay. - That's our show for today. So, see you Wednesday for more tech news with no added hormones. Wow, that's weird.",
