    "transcript": "NOW is when the tech news starts. Go! Apple hosted their Worldwide Developers Conference today Instead of fixing our iMac and the butterfly keyboards in their MacBook Pros. Yeah, if you're new here I'm a little harsh on old Macintosh, they can take it They got lots of money. First off, iOS 12. When it launches this fall, it'll make Siri slightly less useless with shortcuts, essentially a macro app where you can trigger specific actions using custom voice commands. >> They already exist on Bixby. Yeah, exactly. Hmm, BIXBY? iOS 12 will also get grouped notifications like Android: App usage, Dashboard, and time limits like Android. Customisable Animoji, and the ability to FaceTime up to 32 people, and multiplayer AR experiences on top of it. Apple is also working with Pixar and Adobe on a new standardised AR file format called Universal Scene Description, or USDZ, which will enable easy importing of assets from apps like Photoshop into AR. CarPlay will finally get Google Maps and Waze support Good to see you learning your place, Apple Maps >> Ha! It's in the dumpster. Next up, macOS Mojave (I thought we were sticking with the mountain theme here but I guess the deserts work too.) Mojave will bring a dark mode, an App Store redesign, and desktop versions of the News, Voice Memos, Home, and Stocks apps from iOS. Desktop Stacks are basically folders for the desktop, but they automatically collect random files of the same type so your screen is less cluttered. You'll also be able to do some basic editing and markup using Quick Look in the Finder. That's actually kind of cool. Finally, watchOS 5. It's got automatic workout detection, a walkie-talkie mode so you can feel like Buzz Lightyear and you'll no longer have to say \"Hey Siri\". The assistant will start listening when you simply raise your wrist. It'll be a revolutionary way to accidentally send your friends an audio clip of you talking about them behind their back. Sorry if I just activated all your HomePods which all of you definitely have. >> Lol. Hahaha (spoken in a rhythm undescribable) Okay, that's enough Apple, on to our kind of event, Computex. Asus showed off a ton of new hardware today, including the ROG Phone: a 6-inch (15 cm for metric paupers) powerhouse for GGAAAMMERRZZZ! You better believe you can game so hard on this thing! (who put you on the planet,) Eeeh! It's got a 90 Hz display powered by an overclocked Snapdragon 845 with an Adreno 630 GPU, which could run hot. So, there's a game cool vapor chamber cooling attachment. (named \"AeroActive Cooler\") It's got ultrasonic trigger buttons, usable in landscape mode. But if that's not enough, you can use the TwinView controller dock to turn it into a shield-like device. The mobile desktop dock to game using your PC peripherals. Or the WiGig dock--to stream to your TV and then play on the third-party Gamevice controller. Good gravy, Asus, you really want this gaming phone to be a thing, huh? The question is: who will be able to afford this who wouldn't just buy a Switch, or maybe I'm crazy. If you guys are actually interested in this phone, leave a comment below. Let us know. It's time for Quick Bits, brought to you by Memory Express--my new favourite electronics retailer. Whether you are a gamer, business owner, or literally anyone else; Memory Express is your go-to destination in Canada for electronic products and services. If it uses electricity, there's a good chance Memory Express carries it. And trust me, they have the *best* electricity. Plus, with their ber Price Beat Guarantee, they'll beat any authorised Canadian retailer by 10% of the difference both in-store and online--so click the link below for all of the details. >> What does that have to do with Uber though? (ber linus echo) The cars? Aaaaaah, Quick Bits: the ROG phone wasn't the only hardware Asus showed off at Computex. They also presented three new high end monitors, two versions of the new ROG Strix laptop: one for FPS and one for mobile players, the Balteus LED mousepad with phone Qi charging, the Delta type-C gaming headset with a built in DAC, the company's first all-in-one CPU coolers: the Ryuo and Ryujin, I can't say that (now with caption magickery you may be able to spell it) a lineup of AX WiFi-compatible routers, and a full lineup of tough (???)-branded products, including a mouse, keyboard, laptop, and a PC case! >> That's a lot of gear! Good gravy! I already said that. I already said that earlier. (time warp to 2:43) \"Good gravy\" You can be sure Linus Tech Tips will have coverage of a lot of those maybe all of them. I wouldn't know. Nvidia unveiled Isaac, a platform powered by Jetson Xavier a system on-chip intended for AI. At the unveiling when asked about when we'd see the next GeForce cards, CEO Jensen Huang said \"a long time from now.\" but he's gotta be bluffing gotta be bluffing. ***Good gravy!*** Microsoft has acquired code-hosting service GitHub for $7.5 billion in stock; but if you're concerned about their tyrannical rule, don't worry GitHub will still operate as an independent company and will remain an open platform. Or so they say. ****Good gravy!**** Famous overclocker Kingpin has worked with EVGA to develop an all-in-one CPU cooler that uses liquid nitrogen and automatically overclocks chips. It won't be heading to consumers any time soon, but it's super cool. Just like that gamer phone. This thing rocks hard, man! >> Stop! >> (laughery) >> Stop it! Eeeeeeh! And on a lighter note, Mark Jacobs is releasing a fashion-focused smart watch called the Riley touchscreen. That's my name. Do you think he's a fan of the show? Maybe! That's it for this episode of TechLinked, there's a bit too much tech news for my liking, so I have to go recover. Subscribe to the channel if you want to. Hit the bell icon if you feel like it. It's time for me to have a burrito bowl.",
