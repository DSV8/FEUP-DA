    "transcript": "- This episode is sponsored by Storyblocks. With Storyblocks, you have unlimited access to studio-quality 4K stock video. You can check out more at the link below. Hey, guys, and welcome to This Is Now. It's been just over three years since Nintendo started releasing mobile games starting with Miitomo, if anyone remembers that. - [Matt] I don't! - I don't really either. Nowadays, they're pretty common, but back then, the idea of Nintendo releasing first-party games outside of their own hardware was unthinkable. Imagine gracing those mere peasants with phones with Mario karts and Mario and Luigi and other wonderful Nintendo branded characters. They're not ready. Who's gonna buy the 2DS's, Matt? Someone has to buy the 2DS's. You put the games in the phones, no one buys the 2DS. See, instead of competing against Microsoft and Sony with their highest-spec powerful consoles, Nintendo has always focused on having a large library of high-quality first-party games and having them on phones always seemed to be counterproductive to that goal. Especially considering that the Switch has sold millions and millions of consoles, it's easy to forget that just five years ago, Nintendo was actually in pretty dire straits. The 3DS was starting to show its age and the Wii U was, to put it delicately, a complete and utter failure. Though, at the same time, the mobile market was growing exponentially, raking in cash through games like Candy Crush, Nintendo was starting to feel pressured into that lucrative market. The problem was that both Nintendo's president, Satoru Iwata, and Nintendo of America's president, Reggie \"My Body Is Ready\" Fils-Aime, was famously against the idea. They felt like bringing franchises such as Mario, Zelda, and Pokemon would devalue the brand, which uses beloved first-party games to sell hardware. Now the logic there is that, if Nintendo started releasing games such as A Link to the Past on the App Store or Play Store, there would no longer be an incentive for people to actually buy one of their 2DS's. 'Cause all they care about are the 2DS's. (crowd applauds) But, with the failure of the Wii U, Iwata and a group of Nintendo executives, including Mario's creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, came up with a new strategy for the company to become profitable again: mobile games! I don't think they quite said it that excited. They're like: I guess we have to. The new strategy also included developing the console-handheld hybrid that, of course, became known as the Nintendo Switch. Iwata made the decision to have Nintendo partner up with a Japanese mobile company called DeNA to make at least five mobile titles starting with Miitomo. Now their goal was to create games that wouldn't cheapen the experience of playing a first-party Nintendo game. And this, in turn, would advertise the bigger experiences that could only be played on dedicated Nintendo hardware to people who're usually content just playing games on their phones. It's like the drug dealer mentality: give them a little taste and they're hooked. The 2DS's will be flying off the shelves! - [Matt] The first one's free! - The best example of this philosophy is their second mobile game: Super Mario Run. Instead of being free to play, it was free to start which meant that you could download and play a couple levels for free, but then you would have to pay $10 for the rest of the game. Now, in my opinion, this is the best monetization strategy as far as game quality, but unfortunately, out of the seven games Nintendo's released since 2016, it's the only one to use it. The big reason for that is due to the huge price tag of $10 which, of course, isn't bad for a 2DS game, but for a mobile game, Super Mario Run just didn't catch on and it certainly did not sell anywhere near as much as Nintendo would've liked. Even though Super Mario Run was downloaded 200 million times in its first year, less than 10% of those people actually purchased the full game, causing it to earn a still respectable $56 million. Now, while $56 million might sound like a ton of cash, the next game to release was Fire Emblem Heroes in 2017. Just like Mario Run, it was a slightly stripped-down version of its console counterparts, but utilized stamina timers on characters that would refill for free if you waited, of course. They would refill instantly if you paid. Free to play, that's what you'll find on the 2DS. You can also use real money to buy new heroes for your party and, even though it was only downloaded 10 million times in its first three months, it pulled in $100 million its first year, and ended up pulling out a full $300 million. - [Matt] A little bit more than 56. - That's a lot more, by a lot. Especially considering they had like 1/10 the players. Now, if you think this is a bit shrewd for a company like Nintendo, you would be correct. Iwata did his best to make sure that the games would treat players fairly and not have deceptive free-to-play tactics. Unfortunately, he passed away suddenly in 2015, so when Super Mario Run made about half of what Fire Emblems Hero did in the same amount of time, he wasn't there to stop investors from getting greedy. From there, the mobile strategy was set. Every mobile game that Nintendo has released since then has been free-to-play instead of free-to-start. Animal Crossing Pocket Camp utilizes timers and randomized drops for furniture that you used to build up your campsite. And Dragalia Lost, which is a completely new IP that Nintendo has created, employed similar monetization mechanics to Fire Emblem Heroes which, of course, did make over $100 million in its first year. And that brings us to Mario Kart Tour which easily has the worst monetization strategy yet. Now, on the surface, it looks exactly like what everyone would want: Mario Kart on your phone. However, the problem would start when it comes to unlocking, well, pretty much anything. The game starts you out with one driver for free, but if you want to unlock another, you'll essentially have to open a loot box. Of course, the loot box costs five gems which is, the premium currency, is two. Oh, and by the way, it's not guaranteed that you'll actually get that new driver since they're in a pool with karts and gliders because of loot boxes. Now, on top of all of that, you get bonuses in certain tracks for using certain characters. So, if you don't have them, of course, you can always buy some gems and try your luck, but if that's not all bad enough, also, by the way, if you wanna play 200cc, you gotta play five bucks a month because, yikes. I think I got all that, right? I'm pretty sure that's the... - [Matt] That sounds like the gist. - It's like I'm in the galaxy brain right now where it's like we could charge people for it or we could do free-to-play behind gems, behind loot boxes, behind bonuses, or we can throw in a $5 subscription because 200cc. Subscriptions are fine. Battle passes, I'm actually a pretty big fan of in games. I pay for a battle pass sometimes on Crash Royale, for example. There's obviously tons of great subscriptions that are available in other areas where you can buy in all the free-to-play bull (beep) with all the loot box bull (beep) and you throw in a $5 a month subscription. Sorry I'm getting a little profane here. Also, could I just throw a little bit of a hot take in here for a second? - [Matt] Go ahead. - Mario Kart Tour isn't that great of a game. I play it a little bit, it's kind of whatever. Unfortunately for us, the crappy monetization didn't seem to hurt the game at all since it very quickly became the most downloaded mobile game ever, although fun fact: it only lasted about a week thanks to Call of Duty Mobile which you can check out more in our last week's episode of This Is at our... You can check out our last week's episode of This Is where Ken very helpfully broke down the pros and cons of no-scoping in Call of Duty Mobile. So the real question that needs to be answered is whether or not the strategy is working. And the answer is: well, it depends on which game you're looking at. Now Animal Crossing can definitely be marked as a no due to the fact that it came out in 2017. The next full game of the series isn't releasing until 2020. Any hype that Pocket Camp built up will definitely be depleted by then. Now, when it comes to Fire Emblem, things are a bit trickier. The latest release, Three Houses, without question, had the best U.S. launch for the series since it tripled in sales compared to the last game that came out here. Now it's tough to say whether or not Fire Emblems Hero really helped to gain those sales though. I mean I only knew most Fire Emblem characters 'cause they're always in Smash. I'm like, who's Ike? What's a Marth? Mario Kart Tour is another confusing one. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the latest entering the series. Of course, it's a Wii U port that came out well before Tour on the Switch all the way back in 2017. Now, sure, Nintendo could be working on Mario Kart 9, but they haven't announced it yet and there are really no strong rumors that they are. Now, as of April, it is easily the best-selling game of the Switch with almost 17 million copies sold, so Nintendo's probably not in a big rush to make a sequel to it. Honestly, if anything, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe helped promote Tour to other people as opposed to the other way around like mobile games are supposed to. And the best-case scenario here really is Pokemon Go. In the years since it's come out, it's gotten so much better than it was at launch. I say this because Josh, Jimmy, and Matt nonstop play it at work. And I'm like hey, why don't we do some work? They're like nah, we'll go catch some Poke-mans. I'm like okay. - And Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee have directly benefited from the insane amount of people who play Pokemon Go. Honestly, unlike a lot of these other games which are obviously ports and remakes of main games that have been free-to-play... free-to-play-ized, free-to-play-ified, free-to-play-ish, free-to-play-ed. Well, the thing is, with Let's Go, it's almost more of like, that's a mobile port to the main console. I mean, especially like all the mechanics and stuff are nearly identical. Though issue is, well, Nintendo didn't actually make Pokemon Go. All right, so sit down, just stick with me for a second. There's The Pokemon Company which is separate from Nintendo. They teamed up with Niantic, who also is partially owned by Google, and they made Pokemon Go. So while, yes, Nintendo does own part of The Pokemon Company, Pokemon Go doesn't technically count as one of their first-party mobile games because it's Nintendo owns part of Pokemon, Pokemon contracted Niantic, who's of course partially owned by Google, and they made it. But it's like not really a Nintendo game. Actually, it is a Nintendo game, but it's not a first-party Nintendo game. But having said this, from a pure business standpoint, it's hard to say that Nintendo's mobile strategy is failing. Their games are high-quality and well made even though they might have some shady monetization and they're almost always littering the top free downloads on both the App Store and the Play Store. The games are also well supported with constant updates and new additions that do keep them fun and exciting to play. But beyond that, it's definitely a bummer that, after Super Mario Run, they never tried the model that they introduced again. I mean they had a good idea, but then, they threw it away because free-to-play! I mean, personally, I'd gladly pay $20 or $30 upfront for a Pocket Camp or a Mario Kart Tour that would allow me to unlock everything in the game and, you know, playing it for free from that point forward. But I'm curious: what do you guys think? How do you feel about Nintendo's mobile strategy? Let us know in the comments below. Sure there's gonna be some spicy comments on this one.
