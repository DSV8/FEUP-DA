    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin, how's it goin'? A flashcart for your retro game console can open up a lot of possibilities. Not just for playing commercial ROMs, but also homebrew software and game hacks. This time, we'll check out what BitBuilt has to offer for the Game Boy. [ Music - Intro ] BitBuilt has four models of flashcarts available, which they sent me to review. The big differences are the capacity and the features offered. You can get a battery-backed SRAM cart in one or two megabyte sizes. There's also a two meg model with flash for game saves, instead of SRAM. And finally, BitBuilt offers a two meg unit that uses SRAM, but includes a real-time clock for games that need it, like some of the Pokmon titles. They all come preassembled and use original recycled Game Boy cartridge housings. They support both Game Boy and Game Boy Color titles, and you can pick which style of label you want. If you need a programming interface, BitBuilt sells one for about $20 US, and it's capable of both writing and reading cartridges. It's pretty basic; just a plain circuit board with a MiniUSB interface, but it does get the job done. The software it uses is open source and I had no problem getting it installed and working in Windows 10. It's also very straightforward to read and write ROM files, erase the flash cart, and back up your game saves. Which flashcart to go with is gonna depend on how you plan to use it. The two megabyte version gives you the best flexibility if you wanna get into homebrew or game hacks, like Pokmon Prism. The flash memory option alleviates any worries about game saves disappearing if the battery dies. But if you have the programmer, you can always back 'em up. While prices on the cartridges are comparable to others that offer things like SD card storage, BitBuilt does boast broad compatibility, along with support for things like the Super Game Boy and Game Boy Player. So if you're interested in exploring a whole new aspect of handheld gaming, these flashcarts are worth checking out. I owe a big thank you to BitBuilt for sending these out for me to review. I'll include a link to 'em down in the description. If you like the video, I'd appreciate a thumbs-up and be sure to subscribe if you haven't already.
