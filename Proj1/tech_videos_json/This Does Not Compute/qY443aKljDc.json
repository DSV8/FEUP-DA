    "transcript": "Hey everyone, it's Colin, how's it goin'? The NES Classic is a fun system, but the biggest complaint about it is the super short cord on its controller. This time, we're going to take a look at a product that'll unleash you from the console for good. [ Music - Intro ] This is the Retro Receiver Classic Edition from 8Bitdo, who sent it to me to review. The kit includes a controller and receiver and the entire setup works off of Bluetooth. The included controller is 8Bitdo's NES30 model. It resembles the classic NES controller, but adds two action and shoulder buttons. It lasts for about 20 hours before needing to be recharged, which is done through Micro-USB. It's billed as pretty faithful to the original design. The buttons have about the same feel and the texture of the plastic is similar. Also, the Bluetooth connectivity isn't limited to just the receiver. The controller can also pair to computers and mobile devices too. Speaking of the receiver, it's perhaps the star of the show. It plugs directly into a controller port on the NES Classic, and it'll work with any of 8Bitdo's gamepads, but also PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and Wii U Pro Controllers. The pairing process is quick and easy, and there's a Micro-USB port on the side if you wanna use it with a PC. The receiver's small enough that two can be plugged in side-by-side, and what's more, it doesn't need any sort of power supply. It gets all its power directly from the console. Perhaps its best feature though, is that you don't need to get up and press the reset button on the console anymore. The receiver can do it for you if you press either Home or Down & Select on the controller. Overall, the kit works really well. The input lag feels about the same as with the wired controller and the Bluetooth connection proved to be quite reliable. The controller may not be the most ergonomic thing for use during long gaming sessions, but being able to pair a different one is a nice option. The biggest concern with the kit is probably its price. At $40 US, it could be tough for some to justify, considering the cost of the NES Classic itself. But for others, it may be money well spent if it means that to play these retro games, you no longer have to sit on the floor. I owe a thank you to 8Bitdo for sending out a Retro Receiver kit for me to review. I'll include a link to it down in the description, so you can check it out. If you like the video, I'd appreciate a thumbs-up and be sure to subscribe. You can follow me on Twitter and Instagram at thisdoesnotcomp, and as always, thanks for watching.",
