    "transcript": "- Inside of this box is the 14 inch M2 MacBook Pro. This is the specked out 14 inch MacBook Pro and as you guys may know or have seen in some of my previous videos, I was so dead set on getting the 16, 100%. I was so dead set on getting the 16 so you might be wondering, why are you right now on boxing the 14? Well my friends, I wanna start this off by saying, I have never had an Apple product have a problem, any type of issue, even with the butterfly keyboard, when people are having problems with those... I still love the butterfly keyboard. I'm just gonna put that out there and also like I freaking love the touch bar, I actually maybe kind of miss it a little bit. But all that being said, when I was unboxing my 16 inch, I was making an unboxing video. I was super hyped, so excited, and as soon as I opened it... (upbeat suspenseful music) Here we go. (box opening) It's just more exciting because I know this is mine. This is my baby. I've been going to bed every single night thinking, should I have gotten the 14 inch MacBook Pro? Should I have gotten the smaller one? (Justine exhales) Oh my gosh, I can't wait. It's here. It's officially here. (Justine sniffing) It smells nice, so good. So clean, so fresh. (wrapper crumping) (tense music) (computer swiveling) Okay, so... This looks like something... What is that? (tense music) Is that supposed to be like that? This little piece of plastic is coming up. Look right there. (tense music) - What? Oh, this video just took a turn. (suspenseful music) (signal beeps) - I noticed that along the seam of where the display would kind of meet the casing. There was like a small little defect and I was like, this is weird. I don't think that should be like that. I think this may alter the entire course of the- - [Computer] To use English as the main language, press- - Don't talk to me right now. So I'm gonna return this one but now I think that this has made my decision to get the 14 inch MacBook... I think that's what I'm gonna do. Long story short, reached out to Apple Customer Service, they were incredible, I returned the computer, basically got a refund that same day. I also ordered the 14 inch MacBook Pro just right off the Apple website, I didn't have any special treatment. It wasn't like, \"Hey, we're sending you another one.\" No, I went repurchase this from apple.com and it said that it was gonna get here three... It's supposed to be here actually next week. So this came super fast and I'm so, so hyped to open it. Now from day one when I ordered the M2 16 inch I kept having... Not regrets but something kept telling me, \"Justine, I think that you might wanna try the 14 inch.\" But I knew that my MacBook was already arriving, I didn't wanna wait any longer. I have been going to bed every single night thinking, should I have gotten the 14 inch MacBook Pro? Should I have gotten the smaller one? And then this random little mishap happened and it's one of those things where, I strongly believe that everything happens for a reason in life and I'm actually really excited about this 14 inch. Now I'm back to traveling a lot and traveling with a smaller device, something that is lighter because I also sometimes tend to travel with a PC gaming laptop, plus my iPad, and a Kindle. I have a lot of gear inside of a tiny, small, little backpack, so anything that I can do to save space, I'm so here for it. And the thing that I love about the 14 inch is the fact that while I'm saving space, I don't have to give up quality or performance. This also... I know I'm supposed to be unboxing this but I feel like I have so much to talk to you guys about because I have a lot of thoughts. I had been using the 13 inch M1, when that first came out, and to go from that 13 inch to the 16 inch was such a huge jump, I almost felt like, \"Oh, I love this screen real estate, I can't go back.\" But the screen real estate on these 14's it really isn't that much smaller and it is larger than 13. I'm having all sorts of justifications here. I am just very excited about this. I had used the 14 inch M1 in a lot of beta tests but I had never used it as my main device. So here it is, the 14 inch, the unboxing. It's happening now. (upbeat music) (box spinning) (wrapper taring) (Justine gasps) Yes! I did end up getting a Space Gray, I hope I did. I ordered it so quick, I honestly don't even remember. Yes, you are Space Gray and beautiful. And look at this like this, it's such a perfect size. It really is incredible. This is gonna be perfect. Yeah, this is the right decision. It just feels right. (signal beeps) I could not be happier. This came at the perfect time because I started traveling again a lot, and being able to have this much smaller profile computer on a plane has made such a huge difference because I unfortunately fly Spirit Airlines and those freaking seats and their tray table is so teeny tiny. (Justine laughs) I should have taken a video the last time I was on it because I was so freaking cramped. But this was so small that it actually fit right on the tray table. I was able to edit for about four and a half hours, pretty much, and had no issues whatsoever. The thing that I have noticed, I mean I don't know how you couldn't notice it, is the battery life compared to the 16 inch because that 16 inch battery life was phenomenal. Now this one, it's definitely not as good so it is a noticeable difference but it's something that I have been so willing to deal with. I have been carrying just a little portable battery charger and I'll use that to get a little extra juice if I'm on the road or if I'm on a plane. But this has been a freaking game changer. I always wanted to have the biggest and best computers, and having the largest displays and recently I'm like, \"That's actually... I don't really...\" No, this is so perfect for me. I'm able to use a smaller backpack, I can fit this inside of this other little backpack that I have that is so tiny, it definitely, potentially might rip the zippers but I can fit it in there, I can't believe it! This is just... I love it so much. I can't even say enough great things about it. It is... I know I sometimes get a little dramatic and say it's life changing but getting the 14 inch for me, actually has been life changing. I would love to see a compilation of all of the things that I've said that are life changing. The one thing I did notice, I think this might be a Final Cut specific issue that I've been having a little bit of Final Cut lag when I'm editing. I'm kind of, fingers crossed, hoping for an update. But for the most part this thing is... It's so fast. I have traveled pretty much around the world at this point with this laptop and it has not disappointed whatsoever. My biggest concern getting it, was I thought that the screen real estate would be too small because I was so used to editing with a 16 inch and honestly, I don't even think I've noticed at all. I just have this and my phone, and I can basically go and work, and do anything anywhere. And I have the eight terabyte version and with that I'm able to do almost all of my work, right here on the device, I don't even need to bring external drives. Even though I bring them, I don't have to use them. I always do make sure that if I'm working on a project, I have it backed up on an external just in case I lose my laptop or something like that. I just... (Justine exhales) I'm always so afraid of this getting taken because it's like, yes, I would be very sad that I would have to buy a new computer but to be honest, sometimes the files and the video are more important than this device itself. So I do either make sure they're backed up to the cloud or they are on a hard drive somewhere or a solid state drive, most likely it's a solid state. I also like this has a smaller charging brick so that also has decreased the footprint of the devices that I have to travel with. One of the questions that a lot of people have, is do I need to upgrade to the M2 if I have an M1? and I'm just gonna be the first to say, no, you do not. If I wasn't Apple obsessed iJustine, I would've stayed with the M1 because that thing is so freaking powerful. Honestly, you don't need to upgrade. If you do still have an Intel MacBook and you are looking to upgrade, then that's where I say it is time, my friends, go to the M2 or if you can find an M1 cheaper, then honestly that's also a great route to go as well. Either way, I think that you'll be super happy with this and I am so looking forward to WWDC to see what is in store for the next version of macOS and with that my friends, I will see you in my next video.
