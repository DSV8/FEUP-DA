    "transcript": "- We are about to get (soft music) so fancy right now. In front of me is the Thom Browne Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 special edition. And there's so many goodies in here I can not wait to show it to you. So I'm not going to wait. I'm just going to open it up. First let's take a look at the box. This is a substantial, this is hefty. We're greeted with this beautiful little design, the box feels nice. Smells nice, smell that. High fashion. - [Camera man] That smells like a person. - It's smells so fancy in there. This is a premium unboxing experience if I've ever had one. Look at this, this looks like something you would get a fancy hat or some fancy shoes. We're getting a lot of fancy things. We're getting a Z Fold 2, we're getting galaxy buds, we're getting a watch. There's so much inside of here. We've got a little note. Thom wrote this for sure. He hand wrote this and then someone transcribed it. A shift in perspective, a world opened a perfection of the Fold. This is a beautifully designed package. You have your Z fold, we have a Buds Live, and the Watch3. There's an extra little... What is this? There's a drawer. This is like a jewelry box. There's a drawer that has some extra accessories. We have extra watch bands. This is is premium content right here. I've actually never put a case on the Z Fold. So this is going to be the first time testing out, putting a case on it. Feels very nice. Where do I even start? What should I open first? I don't even know. I think I need to take a picture of this cause it looks really nice. Let's take these out of the main box. We've got our Watch 3, got our Buds Live and the Z Fold 2 5G. This has been one of my favorite phones. It's really just such an awesome device. I've had so much fun with it. I can't wait to see this one. Look at this. Would you take a look at this? This is awesome. So it has this really nice kind of a matte finish glass on it, which I really like. And it's got kind of a silverish... I would say it's kinda dark graphite kind of hinge. And this has kind of some raised little... You hear that? Actually I kinda like that. Its feeling grip onto it. That's nice. Let's power it on. It just had a custom little intro. I love the Z fold. It's really cool. While this is checking for updates, you know what we've got to do. We've got two more things that open up. Hold your horses. There's more in here. Look, they've even got these little custom bags for all of the accessories. Shut up. They have these cute little cord wraps with a little button on it. I'm losing my mind. The USB cable even has a little logo on it as well. If you're a Tom Brown fan, you are on cloud nine right now because this is awesome. Do you think the power cable is gonna have a little accessory? This is how you do a premium integration. This is, wow. Time for the Bugs Live. Thom Browne second edition. They even have custom wallpaper, they have custom icons. Let's open this up and look at that. It's so cool. They have all the custom icons, the custom wallpaper. Custom experience. Here's the buds live. They also have a custom case for this as well. These little bags. And look at this, another USB cable with the cute little button wraps. These are just... Have I said that I liked these little bags yet? Here's the Bugs Live. Let's open it up and see. Look at this. Everything is so detailed. The attention to detail on this is just unbelievable. How cool is that? Hey just wondering, do you like Thom Browne? We've got our Thom Browne Buds Live, we've got our Thom Browne Z Fold 2. Now, we need to open up our Thom Browne Watch3. I'm actually really excited about this because during the announcement, I was like, that Watch3 has got some pretty cool features. And now we have a nice Thom Browne one to match all of our other accessories. This looks really good. This is very nice. There is no doubt about it. The quality of all of this stuff is incredibly premium. There's no other word for it. What is better than premium? I'm still thinking. So this watch band actually matches the background that is on the Z Fold 2. We also have two other watch ban options in case you want to switch it up. Can you imagine going out on the town with your Thom Browne phone, watch, your Buds Live and wearing a Thom Browne outfit. Okay, check this out. Look at this. Here's the background that I was talking about. Z Fold 2 background, watch band matches. Let's pair this watch up. They are asking me if I want to add it. Yes, add. Allow, do whatever you want. Hello. Connect. We're ready. This is my first time testing out a galaxy watch. And so far I'm really enjoying the experience. Fashion week, this is going to be my fashion life. I've never tried the galaxy watch before. This is my first time. I like that you can turn the dial. I can find all of my... This is pretty good experience. This is cool. You guys have already given us so many incredible things. There we go. Charging cable. This is even nice too. I love it that they have a very consistent theme. Just look at that, fancy. I can feel even fancier because I even have the case to put on. It's going in. This gives you two options for cases. So you can have this little fold of a case like this. I thought these both went together but no, this is two separate cases. So you have this, you can open up to see your front. You've also got this option. Look, that matches so great. I think I might... This case's the best. Cause if I'm gonna protect this thing... Are you trying to see my notifications? No. This was awesome to check out the Thom Browne edition of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold, they get a say in the song for letting me check this out. Unfortunately I do have to send this back to them, but this was really awesome to be able to show you guys how cool of an unboxing experience this is. It was such a great presentation. And honestly, there's nothing that I love more than a really cool unboxing experience. And this by far is definitely up there in some of my top favorite unboxing experiences. So thank you guys so much for watching if you guys want to subscribe, be sure to do so cause they will have a tons more videos coming out. It is the tech season after all, I'll you later.",
