    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And I am so excited to show you guys what I have on my computer right now. I am beyond ecstatic. And I say this a lot about being excited about things, but this is something very special. Almost every single video that you have seen me make over the past, like five to six years, I have been using plugins from MotionVFX. From my titles to my end cards, to transitions, like everything has come from this company. And just kind of sitting here and reflecting, they have had such a huge impact on my video career. And they've saved me so much time because I just use their plugins. They're so easy to use, so customizable. Which brings me to today's announcement that I partnered with them on their mKeynote with iJustine plugin pack. And I could not be more excited because this has a bunch of things that I have been looking for in a pack. And they're all here. The best part about these is they're so customizable. So something that you might see me use, you could use that same plugin but make it look completely different. And I'm beyond excited to show you these. Now, I'm using Final Cut Pro, which is what I've been editing in for quite a long time. But this pack is also available for Premiere and DaVinci Resolve. So I'm gonna put a link in the description to check it out. And it's very easy to set up. There's a little program called mInstaller which you install that, which allows you to have an entire library of all of your plugins. So not only do they have mKeynote, they have a ton of others. They make it super easy to install and update. So it isn't just like, hey, you installed this once and then they don't do updates. All of the plugins that I have previous that worked on my Intel Mac, they have been all upgraded for M1, which is very exciting. So once you have it installed, it'll show up here in your titles under mKeynotes. And we're gonna go through each of these just so you can kinda see and get a sense of what these look like. It brings a ton of minimalist designs and animations all into one really great pack. As a content creator and video editor, MotionVFX has been my number one go-to for all of my plugins and animations in my videos over the past couple of years. So I'm so excited to partner with them to bring you guys, mKeynotes. And if you guys don't know, I'm a huge fan of Apple and all of their Keynote presentations because they have such a clean, minimal design. So we brought the best of both worlds and put them all in one into this really easy to use plugin pack. We have these beautiful backgrounds that vary from different colors to animations, to even this one, which I love so much. It's the blurred background. I use this feature a lot in some of my videos to blur the backgrounds and then put text over top. But with this it's super simple to do. We just drag and drop and you automatically have that blur in and blur out of your background. There's a selection of boards, which will allow you to add various types of texts, titles, animations, graphics. Like this one for example, is you can change the type of social network. So let's go to YouTube. And since I just hit 7 million subscribers, check that out. There's a bunch of really fun call-to-action. Like this one that says, buy. But of course, if you don't want it to say buy all of the text and colors are all customizable. Something that I do a lot for my videos in tech reviews is there's always a ton of specs and it gets a little tedious to go and edit those and make new graphs. I'm not gonna have to do that anymore because there's an entire section for infographics. We have different types of bar charts. We even have a calendar. I like this for release dates of when products are coming out, various line graphs, different types of progress bars. And last but not the least we have specs and traits. This is gonna be perfect when I'm detailing out different types of specs for products that I'm reviewing. There's some logo animations and these are so easy to use. If you already have a logo, all you have to do is drop it right here into the drop zone and instantly your logo is animated. I really love the miscellaneous section. This has so many fun little things. We have a clock, we have a locate pin, number, progress bar. We would tag, a smart cloud, and a website address. This next section is placeholders. This is something that I am so excited about. I always try to lay out different photos and videos and I can never actually get them to line up perfectly, but with this, I can choose which template I like. And then I can drag and drop in each piece of footage whether it's a video or a photo and everything is lined up perfectly. Again, it's all customizable and extremely easy to use. I think these all look really great. I love the rounded edges on a lot of these. And I really like this Placeholder Seven because this gives you 10 different drop zones and it'll make it super easy to be able to drag and drop in all of your footage, photos, videos and have them all line up perfectly. The typography section is a huge part of this pack as well. There are so many different options to choose from. I love adding text to my videos when I'm talking about something, just to add some extra emphasis. Also, sometimes just sitting here talking on a blank wall can get a little boring. So let's spice it up with a little bit of text or a lot of bit of text. It's really hard to say. You can really do whatever you want. That's the beauty of it. So my friends, that is a first look at mKeynote. This is obviously inspired by my love of minimalist design and typography and all things Apple. So I'm very excited for you guys to get a chance to check this out. I look forward to seeing it in some of your future projects. (gentle music)",
