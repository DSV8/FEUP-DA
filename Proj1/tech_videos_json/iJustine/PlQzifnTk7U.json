    "transcript": "- What's up guys, it's Justine, and today we are going to be doing a waterproof test of the new Samsung S9. Before we get into that, I just want to preface this with saying, I don't know how to swim, which is also problematic. I don't really like going underwater so doing this video it's going to be really difficult for me, and I'm sure you guys are gonna make fun of me, but that's okay, I'm sure I've heard worse. But this is the new S9, I did an unboxing video and I'll be doing a review video of the camera comparison between this and the iPhone 10. The S9 is IP68 rated, so it is water resistant up to 5 feet, which hopefully we won't go any further than that. Dust and sand resistant, and since we're in Hawaii, it is getting a test of all of those things as we speak. How does it look, Jen? - [Jen] It's a look. - It's a look. Got our phone, let's get it all set up here. Do you think it's gonna recognize me? - [Jen] No. I don't know! - Oh, it did! - [Jen] Hmm. - Oh. - [Jen] So is that just your look then? - I'm not sure, maybe this is what I look like. Oh god, we also have to deal with our pool cleaning here. But we're just gonna let him go and do his thing. Alright. You ready, Jen? - [Jen] No. - Get the go-pro ready. The underwater test is about to commence! This is gonna be so not even that exciting I feel like. (water splashing) I'm a really pathetic swimmer. (laughs) I don't even think I moved anywhere! (laughs) Okay I'm gonna try to swim across this pool. I told you guys I can't swim! Let's see what happens, ready? (melodic music) So it looks like everything is working pretty well. I think so. Camera is functional. Phone's workin'. I'm still alive. So we're gonna try out the super slow mo, and it's interesting because with this, there is a little box on the screen. And whenever some action or movement happens inside of that screen, that's when the Samsung decides this is what we wanna get in slow mo. So you're gonna hit this button. (melodic music) Now we're gonna test out the back camera, I have it set to UHD. And we're gonna do some underwater tests with that, see what it looks like. You ready Jen? - [Jen] Yeah, I don't have to get in, I'm having fun. - [Justine] Get that GoPro ready. (upbeat music) Shoot. What have I done? What have I done? Ah, Bixby, C'mon Bixby! - [Jen] Bixby. - [Justine] Bixby! It's like Bixby I don't need you right now! (heavy beat music) Well, thank you guys so much for watching. I actually had a lot of fun testing this out, so I'm looking forward to checking out all of the footage. I hope you guys enjoyed it as well. I am currently working on an S9 versus iPhone 10 video, so look for that very, very soon. If you guys wanna subscribe, feel free to do that below. And I will see you in my next video. (upbeat music)",
