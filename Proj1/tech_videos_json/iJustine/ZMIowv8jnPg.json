    "transcript": "- Hey guys it's Justine, and I'm here with Ro. - Hello! - Today, we are about to unbox an Easy-Bake Oven. - (laughing) Yes! - [Justine] I got this Easy-Bake Oven, and, as you guys can see, it looks like it's been in a Dexter kill room. I miss Dexter. - Just cover it all in plastic wrap, just round and round. - Do you remember when we baked in an oven before, but it was like a knock-off brand? It was that pink oven. - [Ro] It was not great. - [Justine] No. - [Ro] No. - A lot of stuff happened in that video. But that was fun. - Well, I had a great time. - I definitely had a good time. - [Ro] But the food wasn't great. - [Justine] Food, not good. - Wonderful time, and we're doing it again. A little baking, a little gadget testing. I haven't played with one of these in years. - Well, let's do it now. Okay, mix the cookie dough, pour chocolate chip-- - Happy accidents. - One and one fourth teaspoon of water! That's it? - Yeah, that's it. - [Justine] How is that going to-- - [Ro] That's like my drool, just drool a little. - Chip cookie mix in, so wait, this is? - Just pour it in there. - How's that going to work? That's it? - Yeah. And I got us these. Do I mix it now? - Yeah. - And this is chocolate chip cookies? - That's chocolate chip. - Okay, talk about a dump and stir recipe. - Here you go. That is the pink dough. - Wow, there's a lot of it. - Yeah, we're making different color cookies. This dough looks nice. I think that we did a really good job. - [Ro] I like the chocolate chip cookie dough a lot. - [Justine] This is going to be really delicious. - [Ro] What's this? Smells like a vanilla cake mix. - Oh, it does, yeah. Super simple. It takes nine minutes to bake? - That's fast, right? - Who has time for that? Oh. Is that fast? - Is it? - I don't know. - To bake? Is that enough time? - I don't know. - You don't even like that it's nine minutes, though. - No, I want it to be done instantly. - What about your infrared, how fast does that cook? - You can make cookies. I made muffins, they were so good! - Can you make me a blueberry muffin. - They were blueberry, they were incredible. - (gasping) Yeah - It has a little muffin tin of six, and I made six, and I ate all of them. Over the course of an hour. - Yeah let us know in the comments below what your favorite muffin is. - It better be blueberry. - Mine's blueberry. - Oh I love the coffee cake with the little crumbles. - Oh, yeah. - How's your cookie doing? - It's crumbly, but you know what I'm just going to push it together and pretend it's fine. It's food, but it's- - Fake food. - Yeah. - All right, well, we don't know what's going to happen. Sprinkle flour on your hands and shape the dough into 12 small balls. - (laughing) This is enough for one cookie and they want us to make 12 little ones. - Absolutely not. So I think- - (laughing) - what is happening is they want- - But maybe they'll bake evenly. - They want you to make 12 of this, and then 12 of that. - But I think that we're not going to do that. We're going to make 6 and 6. - See I think I made this too mushy now. I'm getting flour. - That's really freaking small. - I'm going to get just a dribble. - That's a lot of flour. - [Ro] My whole pantry is filled with these. I have so many tubs, - Wow. - Of powdered sugar, sugar, flour. - You've got everything. - Want a little flour? - I'm going to need a little flour. - Here, dip your little fingers in there. Get a little flour. There you go, and let's make little mini cookies. - Sprinkle flour on your hands and shape dough into small balls. - 12 small balls. - We'll just do six. We're just going to see what's going to happen. Space them evenly on the baking pan and flatten. - One, two, oh wow. - Yours look great, mine look like turds. - I only have one- - (laughing) of flour. - Also let us know in the comments below if Justine and I should go to Hawaii again. - We should. - Because I think the answer is yes. - Probably by the time we post this video- - And- - We'll have already gone twice. - (laughing) And I want to go on another adventure. Our first adventure we went kayaking, we hiked to a waterfall, - Yes! - Justine flew a drone right by a waterfall, landed on a slippery rock, she landed a drone on a slippery- I was very impressed- - Now - by the drone skills. - I don't even bother landing them, I just grab it out of the sky. - Really? Oh that's a good call. - Okay so, we've got to figure this out. Which end do we stick it in? It looks like this end. - This is the cooling end. - No! - No, I lied. - [Justine] How do I stick it? Oh I think I push it. - [Ro] I think we (mumbling). - [Justine] Yeah, jam that in there. - Okay how far, when do I stop? - I don't know. (screaming) Too far! - Too far? - Wait! - Oh okay, here, here, here. - I can jam it in this way. - Okay. - I think it's in. - Is it in? - Set a timer for nine minutes. - [Computerized Voice] Okay. Nine minutes and counting. - Okay, that means we have nine minutes to make icing. - Yeah, I love that you have a sous chef. - Yes her name is Siri. - And she's so great. - We have lemon frosting and chocolate frosting. - What's going to go, should we make both? Yes, we're going to need. I have these two bowls. Look at this. - [Justine] Okay, three fourths. One, two... - Come on, powder! - Three, and just because I know I'm just going to put a little more in. Just because why not. - Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow. Is this lemon, or just vanilla? It's supposed to be lemon. Oh I can smell it now, lemon. - I put too much water in again. - This is a thick frosting, I'm going to keep this one thick. - I smell something. - I smell cooking. - I think it's cooking. - Oh I smell something. - Oh this is warm. - Look, it's coming out of these air vents. - Oh it is, actually. Oh, The timer is done! Okay here it is. Okay, come here you little- - [Ro] Take it out of there, like a little pizza. Here take this, don't burn yourself. Don't burn yourself. They look like cookies! - I'm impressed! - They look like cookies. - Whoa. - [Ro] That's cute. - This is really cute. - We have to put icing on them. Look at them! - [Justine] We did a really good job. - [Ro] Two of mine stuck together. - Ow! - Hot? - Wow, they're really warm. Are we supposed to spray the pan? No. - Are we? - I don't know. I didn't read the directions, I barely read them. - Justine if I flip this upside down is it going to stick? - Oh, definitely. - Oh no. I mean look at this, you guys. - We've got a problem. - They're stuck. (yelling) They're still on the pan, they haven't moved. - (laughing) - And it landed upright, so they're okay. We're okay here, everyone, don't worry. But literally, they didn't move. - They did not. - They're still on there. We can touch it I think. It's a bit hot. - [Justine] It's a bit warm. There we go, we got one. (laughing) - So, I think maybe, we're going to be able to get a cookie out of this. Oh! - They're cookies. All right, let's put some of these together. Going to use a lot of icing here, make it really nice. Okay I'm going to load it up, perfect, look at that. Cookie sandwich, just like the box. - Hold it up really close to your eye. It looks like we did a really good job. (laughing) - Yeah, this is the good side. Don't look in the back. This is the good side. - [Justine] Kind of like our gingerbread house. - It had a good side. - Do we try it? - Yeah, I think we should. But I want to try half of yours. Can you cut me half? - Yeah, let's really just share. - I'll give you the pretty side. This one does have a pretty side. Let me taste it. - Oh, it's quite good. - Actually tastes like a cookie. - Oh, color me impressed. - Wow! - Did you try yours yet? - No, okay here we go. - Cheers. - Cheers to the pink lemon cookies. - Oh my gosh. - The icing's really good. - I am shook. I'm just going to take a little sample. The icing is good! - I'm actually doing a second bite. This was actually- - Oh my God. - These are approved by me, these are great, what? - Why the heck is it so good? - I don't know. All right little cookies. Yum. - Here's the problem. - The pan. Should we make another one? - Let's be lazy moms, okay? Let's just have a day where we're lazy moms and we don't clean the pan. Let's cook on top of it, what's the worst that could happen? - Do you want to do one more? - Yeah, let's do one more. - Let's do this one, because I think there's only one. - [Ro] Is three bowls enough? - Yeah, I think because what's happening here- - If we need more, I have more. - Is, this is a refill unit, so if you want to make a lot of them. - Oh, for an oven bake party. - Yeah. - Okay, great. - [Justine] So for all your friends. This says to bake for 16 minutes. - Whoa! - I don't like that time. - 16 minutes? - Well, I think we need to spray. - Oh yeah, let's spray. We've got spray. Okay, here's a little, boop boop boop. Okay, that's plenty. - Here's our oven, I'm just going to bring this up. - Yeah if you could bring over the oven, thanks Justine. - All right, we've got the cake batter, it is in the pan. - I refuse to let this cook longer than nine minutes. - It should be fine. - Set a timer for 10 minutes. - Good call. Okay, sprinkles. Boom! I am your sous chef today, madame. Here is your one tablespoon- teaspoon? Teaspoon? - I don't know, I forgot what I said. I'm fired. - It's a teaspoon. (laughing) I'm going to test the frosting. - Oh that's nice. - Is it good? - It's more like a brownie, like a fudge. - Let me taste. - That's nice. - Mm, yeah it's chocolate fudgey. - [Justine] It's very nice. I think it's ready. - Chocolate? - I don't know. - Chocolate, come be my best friend. - I got a hot mitt, I got a mitt, I got a plate. Aw come on, come on. - Oh, wow! Okay, well it just shot right out. - Is it cooked? Is it cooked? It looks cooked. - It looks pretty cooked. - Looks done. This just looks like a turd. - (yelling) It's really hot. - Oh, Justine! - So I guess we smash this together. - Yeah, smash it up. Then we'll roll the little balls and then put this on there. - Pour the sprinkles in there. - Yeah, pour them in. - Yeah, we're going to make, we're going to have a cake sundae. - This is our own recipe. I mean, I need a spoon. We just need to eat it right here. - Let's go. - This is it, this is dessert time. Tastes like a cake brownie. - It really does. - Oh wow. - Whoa. - Wow, I like the crunchies too. - I like this because this is a substantial amount. - I'm having another bite, mm. I'm shocked. - I'm so happy right now. - Gold stars for us today. - That's it. We're going to go eat this in private. (laughing) This was really fun, this was way more fun than I thought. I'm going to suggest maybe we make something else in here another day. - Uh, yes. - Guys make sure you go check out Ro's channel I'll put all of her links below, and that is all we've got for you today. I don't think I can handle any more. We'll see you later. Bye!",
