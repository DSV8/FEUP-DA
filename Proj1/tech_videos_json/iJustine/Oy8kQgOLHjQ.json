    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and Oh boy, the rumors are already happening, like they've been talking about the iPhone 14 since the iPhone 12 so here we are. We are in the year of the iPhone 15. It kind of feels so weird to say that like it's crazy to think the iPhone 15 is gonna be here before we know it. So as per usual, we've got some rumors. So this photo recently just leaked and this is on Mac Rumors and this is supposedly an image of the iPhone 15 design in full. And I love that there is so much branding over top of this to say who leaked it that you basically can't even see the image at all. This literally could be anything. We get it, we get it. You leaked the image. Congratulations. I guess what you can sort of tell from this is it looks like the dynamic island and the area for the camera and everything is still gonna be in the same place. So that looks pretty similar, but what this does also show off is here is showing us the bottom of the iPhone which that my friends is USB-C. But that unfortunately is probably because Apple is being forced because of all of the regulations to switch the phones over to USB-C. But for me, I'm excited about that cause that is one less cable that I am gonna have to carry. But honestly, lightning is still gonna be supported for many years on because a lot of the older iPhones people still have, people are still buying the cables for those phones. So I feel like lightning is gonna be around for many, many years. Speaking of cables, you guys should check out pinkijustinecables.com and get some pink cables for yourself. We've got USB C, thunderbolt and lightning. Anyway, so saying that this is the entry level iPhone 15 there's no major design changes compared to the iPhone 14. It's also saying that rumors have indicated that the dynamic island will also be coming to the lower entry models of the 15, so just like the regular 15 and the 15 plus. So that's kind of exciting. So now everyone will get to experience that wonderful trip to the dynamic island. So now here on Mac Rumors, they have an entire page that's dedicated to iPhone 15 rumors so let's take a look at this and get more in depth. The standard iPhone 15 models will get upgraded to the A16 chip while the 15 Pro models could get an improved 3-nanometer A17 chip. Now Pro models could also see an upgrade to titanium frames, along with a periscope lens camera technology for improvements to zoom. That's gonna be exciting and that's really the reason that a lot of us do end up going the Pro models is because the camera system does have slight improvements over the lower end models. Pricing on the 15 is expected to be about the same standard entry level 6.1 inch devices starting at 799 and the 6.7 inch iPhone 15 plus starting at 899. Now the design is where I'm getting hyped up. So they're saying that the rumor suggests that the iPhone 15 models will look similar to the 14 but the pill-and-hole cutout will expand the entire lineup. Of course, the other major design change is USB-C. Look at that USB-C port, just shining shimmering. It is so splendid, hyped for that. Now another rumor is suggesting based on those CAD drawings that the new iPhone 15 could be a little bit larger. It could have a 6.2 inch screen instead of a 6.1 inch display. I just feel like a little bit bigger of a screen like I'm not mad about it. But also when I picked up the iPhone mini the other day I forgot how incredibly small that thing was. And I do feel like now that I even have the smaller MacBook, I'm like, man I kind of think I wanna pair down my items. I want things to be smaller, more portable but I don't know the max display, it just looks great. They're also saying that all iPhone 15 models could be equipped with a more power efficient OLED display, which is nice. And this right here stopped me in my tracks, took my breath away. The iPhone 15 models color options could be available in dark pink and light blue color options except I'm a little sad because this is just the regular, this is the base models. It's the 15, not the 15 Pro, not the 15 Pro Max. Like we want those colors too over here in the Pro department. Do you think that we don't want that? We do, I do. Let me see a show of hands of anybody else that might. I just think that we need a little more dynamic. Okay, Tyler's over there, a hand is raised. Pro models need more dynamic colors. I love the purple color of the iPhone 14 but like it wasn't purple enough. Like you should have just went all the way like make it purple, make it pink. This is, this is beautiful. This is absolutely just love that pink, love that blue. Like that's, we want that over in the Pro department. iPhone 15 Pro exclusive design. So it looks like there will be a few design changes that are exclusive to 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max is saying that it's gonna feature thinner, more curved bezels, the iPhone 14 Pro models. And you can see that up here at those renders. You can tell like the corners are a little bit more rounded. The Pro lineup is expected to feature more curved front glass that better disappears into the frame. That's gonna look nice. It's gonna kind of remind you probably a little more like the Apple watch, how it's more rounded and the glass kind of blends into the frame. That's gonna look really nice. This is also something that's interesting. The button design will be tweaked in the Pro models with Apple adopting solid state volume and power buttons that would be similar to the Home button in the iPhone seven and the Force Touch trackpad on MacBooks. Kind of cool, like I'm into this, but I'm also curious how this is gonna affect case manufacturers because if you actually have to be like touching it like it's more of a forced touch. So I don't know how that's gonna affect cases but it says the solid-state button would use haptic feedback to instead mimic the feel of a button press so it's not gonna be like a real button. In theory I'm into it, but like execution-wise like how is this gonna affect us with cases? Because I still, I mean I use this silicon case which obviously if this is an Apple case I'm sure Apple will make a case that will take full advantage of this. Will this make it difficult for third party manufacturers to make cases? Probably. Here's a nice little render, we'd love to see it. No Touch ID. Yeah, I've given up we've, I've not even.... we're not gonna have Touch ID like, it's fine. I don't even, I'm not even asking for it at this point. It's fine. Here's some camera updates. Apple is expected to adopt Sony's latest state-of-the-art image sensors for the iPhone 15 models. We love to see it. Compared to standard sensors, Sony's image sensor doubles the saturation signal in each pixel, allowing to capture more light to cut down on underexposure and overexposure. The sensor will allow for improvements in portraits and other images even when strong back lighting is an issue. This is gonna be kind of interesting. They're saying that they may use a periscope zoom lens technology for the iPhone 15 Pro Max. So we've definitely have heard these rumors in the past but this will be limited to the larger size iPhone 15 Pro Max. This is nothing new. Apple has done this in the past. It was on the iPhone, not the last one, so it was the 13, or maybe it was at the 12th. I think it was the 13 when they added in the Pro Max version had the larger zoom range on the telephoto. So it's not surprising but I'm gonna be interested to try that out. Periscope lens technology offers optical zoom capabilities that exceed those possibilities with a standard telephoto lens allowing for 5x or even 10x optical zoom. I mean that's gonna be a pretty significant change. Like if you're able to get 5x up to 10x optical zoom on your iPhone, that's game changing. Digital zoom is a whole nother story. You'll still be able to zoom in even further but that's kind of just digital and it's not gonna be as clear as optical. Qualcomm Modem Chips. Apple will be using Qualcomm's 5G modem chips for the 2023 iPhone 15, love to see it. Oh, there were rumors suggesting that Apple could use its own in-house modem chips as soon as 2023, but it looks like they won't be ready until 2024. I mean, Apple might as well just bring everything in-house at this point. Like they're doing such a great job with the M1 and M2 chips. Like just do it. Just do it all. Take it. Wi-Fi 6E leaked iPhone 15 Wi-Fi chip diagrams, confirm that Apple's upgrading to Wi-Fi 6E. Okay, great, love that. A-Series Chips, release date September, 2023. And then I made the mistake of clicking on another link that said iPhone 16 Ultra, the iPhone Ultra. Like can we just, can we just enjoy the now, she says as she continues to read the article. iPhone Ultra, it's gonna be Apple's most expensive and feature-rich iPhone. We don't have too much insight right now, says the article. Okay, well yeah, I feel like this is a possibility like having that Ultra lineup with like the Apple Watch Ultra and an iPhone Ultra. I don't know. Now that they have this satellite technology I feel like they could make a legit satellite phone. Like they could have this Ultra be something that you could then turn on the satellite capabilities, be able to actually interact and chat and text like you could a regular satellite phone not just in emergency situations. So I don't think that says anything about that here but like look at this. Look. Oh my God, look at this design. Oh yes, this, oh, it's sick, it's freaking sick. Like that looks great. I love this render. I love the attention to detail they have. These buttons look like they're a little bit more protruding so if you are out hiking or something you can actually hit them. They also have the orange accents around the USB-C and the little action button there as well which is pretty cool. This is a really great design and I hope it actually comes to life maybe this year. Who knows? Speaking of who knows, I don't. I just read this all online so I have no inside knowledge, so don't think that I'm spilling anything that is not already publicly out there that people have already speculated on. I wish I did, but I don't. But I'm super hyped about the future and I've actually have been really enjoying my 14 inch MacBook. Have I even told you guys about this? Mm, I don't think I edited that video yet. Well, thank you guys so much for watching. I obviously love looking at rumors and checking them out so let me know what you guys think. Well, you guys think of this iPhone 16 Ultra. Maybe it'll be an iPhone 15 Ultra, maybe it'll just be an iPhone Ultra and it's gonna be in a whole new category of its own. It's not gonna have a number. It's gonna be kind of just like the Apple Watch Ultra which I'm hoping that they do a smaller version of the Apple Watch Ultra. I still love it. I still use it every single day except for today. I say every single day and I was like I wanna try this one out so I'm going to dinner. So I wanted to like wear a little, like, you know dress it up a little, wear the gold, looks nice. Man! The ultra. It's just, it's so great, the battery life so good that there are days that I don't even charge it at night and I'm good to go pretty much the entire next day. Anyway, this has nothing to do about the Apple Watch Ultra but I'm gonna end the video now. I'll see you guys later. Bye.",
