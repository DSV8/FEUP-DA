    "transcript": "- Today we are doing an original Iphone vs. Iphone X. Lets go take some photos and compare the two. This is going to be a very interesting comparison considering there's no front facing camera, there's no video, there's really just one single, tiny, little camera. Can you see that? Look at that. It's a little baby. (upbeat music) Can you believe this, what I've got in my hand right now? - I'm afraid we're going to see that crack today. - I almost dropped it the other day when I was opening the box. - If you drop it, I'll slap it into the sand. It's real shiny. - Okay, lets take some pictures here. - [Camera Woman] Take a picture of Ed. - Take a picture of my beautiful body, I mean come on. - Okay a picture of Ed, original Iphone. (camera clicks) Wow, that was a very slow shot. (camera clicks) Now here's a picture of Jenna taking a picture. The original Iphone didn't have video or a front facing camera, so this is how we had to take selfies, this was my method. I still got it! I look just as young as I did ten years ago. So this will be a comparison between the first Iphone back-camera and the new Iphone front facing camera, since I can see myself. Back facing selfie. (upbeat music) I just went to hit the home button, but there's no home button. This home button was revolutionary. (tranquil music) So I had a wardrobe change to make it look like my B-roll was from several different days of using the phone, but that's silly and I just changed my clothes for no reason. But now we're going to go and we're going to get a coffee and I'm going to try to use Apple Pay. I don't think the Barista will get the joke. Okay. (crowd chatter) It's like not even a funny joke, like this phone is 11 years old. This phone is older than the children sitting in the corner. Okay here's a shot of my coffee with the Iphone X, so I got to figure out the good focal length, so that it's actually going to be in focus. I don't think a single picture I've taken today has been in focus. It takes so long, okay, that's, wow, hey you can zoom. - [Woman] It makes you look younger because it's not as crisp. It doesn't look that bad. - [Justine] It doesn't look bad but it doesn't look good. - [Woman] Who is that? - A man. Wait look at this, dur. (laughs) The photos do tend to run a little bit on the darker side. Which is kind of cool because nothing is really ever overexposed. That's the rust (mumbling) It's really bad. Literally the focal length there is no macro shot. And that's the first photo on my phone. - [Man] Are you crying? - I was actually, 'cause we got the phone to work. Thank you. (tranquil music) So I know this is the end of the video, but this is how we shot the intro shot. Much like my This is Iphone X video, I wanted to recreate that, but with the original phone. So, here was the This is Iphone X shot, - [Woman] This is Iphone ten, not X, 10. - And now here's the same thing with the original Iphone. (tranquil music) So I'm going to take a few more photo comparisons, and see what this beach looks like here on the original Iphone and the Iphone X. (camera clicks) - [Woman] Wow that's slow. - I know, it's so slow. Look at that, I can tab, I can adjust the exposure. Guess what I can't do here? Anything. It's so slow. If you guys enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell so you'll be alerted when I make new videos, and if you guys have any other ideas for what you would like me doing videos about with this original Iphone, now that it's working, leave those also in the comments below, and I'll see you guys in the next video! Bye! Oh boy, you guys know how many times it took me to do that outro. A lot! Okay so now Ed's taking a picture of me. Oh my god I'm going to get hit. - I'm gonna get hit. No we need a picture, okay. - Wow your shadow hands look gigantic. - I definitely couldn't of picked a worse place to take this photo. (upbeat music)",
