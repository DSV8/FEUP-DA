    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today we're unboxing the brand new Elite controller for Xbox. Now this is a custom one, so before you were able to go into the Design Lab and you can customize Xbox controllers but now you can actually customize the Elite controllers, and I'm so excited about this. I already obviously customized mine online, ordered it and it's here. So let's open it up and check it out. What's cool is not only can you custom design the actual controller, but you can even customize the paddles and the buttons as well and the D-pad. Oh my goodness, I forgot what I made it look like. This looks so freaking good. I mean, if you're a fan of pink, then you're gonna love this. If you're not a fan of pink, well that's not my problem, because I am. And look at this and we need to zoom in, we need to really get a good look at it. I also added a little engraving here of my Xbox Gamertag. The Elite controller's just, it's so smooth, so freaking smooth. Oh, this looks so good. Oh my gosh, it turned out so great. Now, what I love about the Elite controller is you're able to add paddles back here. So I usually use that to crouch, to slide, and depending upon the game, you can customize it to do really whatever you want. So this button right here will let you adjust the trigger tension. So right now, it's long all the way. We're gonna switch it to the short, so this gives you an advantage. You don't have to press all the way in to get a shot. Oh, this feels so good. I can't wait to play Call of Duty. Like I'm just, I'm so excited. All right, let's open up the paddles here. Oh, oh, look at 'em. They're so pretty. These were all add-ons in addition to doing the controller. So you obviously don't have to get these, but there was no way I was making this beautiful custom controller and not fully decking it out. Oh yeah, look at that. I can just pop this right out, attach that. We are ready to go. Here's our different buttons. Look, you just pull it off. That's it. So look at that. That's like a very long joystick. Let's do one of these and one of these. To be honest with you, I kind of just like the ones that it came with, so that's probably what I'm gonna be using. But I wanted to get this so that I would be able to have the swappable D-pad as well. Okay, so here's the paddles. We're gonna put those on the back, so you're able to just use your fingers like that. I love this controller so much, it's so beautiful. I'm so hyped about it. I can't wait to play Call of Duty. Unfortunately, I have to go to dinner so I can't play tonight. This weekend? Maybe, can I play this weekend? I don't know. I've been so busy. I don't like being busy. I like to just play video games. I'm getting hyped for the holidays 'cause that's usually when me and my sister just sit at home and play video games all the time. So my case hasn't come in for this yet but I did get a custom case for it. (upbeat music) And here it is. This is the final look, the final Elite controller. And if you guys wanna check this out, I will put a link in the description, if you wanna check out the Xbox Design Lab, you can design one of the Elite controllers or you can just design one of the regular controllers as well. I'm so happy with how this turned out. It's really beautiful. Well, thank you guys so much for watching. Let me know if you've ever designed one of these custom controllers. If you have, I would love to see them. Please send me them on Twitter, tweet me @ijustine and send me your custom controllers, whether you've done it recently or you've done it a long time ago, I'd love to see them. Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe and I'll see you in the next video. Bye-bye. (upbeat music)",
