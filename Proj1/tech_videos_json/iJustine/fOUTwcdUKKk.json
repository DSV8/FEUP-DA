    "transcript": "- WWDC was today, the keynote was incredible, it was one of the most action packed, fast just insane keynotes that I've ever experienced. - Especially being there in person, they were going through these slides so fast. But one of the huge hightlights was the Mac Pro and I'm not gonna lie, that was something that I did not think that they were going to announce today, but they did and it is here. So right now we're in kind of the product demo area, so there's a bunch of different stations set up and they also announced new Pro Displays. There's two different models of those, but I can see it here and talk to you guys forever, lets go, check out and see some of the things that they have for us to see. (electronic music) Okay so they're showing an AR demo, wait, how cool! So this is the Pro Stand it comes in two different models so you can decide if you wanna have the stand or if you wanna have the mount. This thing is absolutely just beautiful. Just look at it. Wow, so what's crazy is you can spec this thing out to be 28 cores, I mean, for comparison, my iMac Pro is 18 cores, so I can't even fathom the speed of this things, it's so amazing. So right now we're doing a custom AR experience that is built around the Mac Pro. Oh, no way! AH! - [Technician] Go there and tap on the rim. So what I love about this is everything's modular so it's future proofing so if you need to upgrade down the line, this makes it so simple. Here's the built-in speakers. Wow, see that? No way! This is such a cool experience. What I love about this is it really shows you how modular it is, like everything is built to be expanded. Oh, 1.5 Terabytes of memory. Sign me up! I'm gonna have to sell my house and my car. Goodbye, it really looks beautiful. I'm just speechless. (electronic music) One of the things I love so much about this is it is expandable, and I think that's one of the things that was so difficult with the iMacs and the iMac Pros, all those lines, it was so difficult to update, whereas this everything's modular. So right now we're in the editing workflow room and this is amazing, so right now we have over here one of the robotic cameras and they're taking this footage, sending it over here, compositing it, and then we have over here another workflow to go into the editing and then over here you've got your coloring station and then this is really great, they have a Mac Mini cluster server over here. This is so overwhelming, this is my dream office in this room right now. So I know I'm not the best at coloring but this right here is some motivation and inspiration. It's beautiful. There's so many incredible workflow rooms in here, lets go check out a few more. (electronic music) Today was so overwhelming, I mean we went from place to place, we saw so many incredible things, I hope you guys enjoyed it, there'll be more videos coming soon with some more detailed stuff, talking about WWDC, but that's it for now, I'll see you guys later, I gotta go edit now, bye.
