    "transcript": "So you guys have seen the unboxing and Now it is time to do the iMacPro 18 Core 128 gigs of ram 4 terabyte solid State drive setup and yes I got the 4 Terabytes you guys really see why don't Ask questions you should know not to do What by now let's set up this is a clean Desk day for me this is my current Setup this is actually my sister's 5k iMac because she never really uses it That often so I said girl let me borrow That until I get my iMac Pro in and now That I've got it this can go back home To Jenna so when I'm not editing on the 5 k iMac I pretty much edit everything on My Macbook Pro touch bar the export time In comparison from this to the iMacPro Is insane later on in this video I'll Show you guys a comparison of how long It took me to export my home pod video On this MacBook Pro in comparison to the iMacPro so without further ado let's Just set this computer up because I'm Freaking out I don't want to talk I have a problem I'm also eating Pretzels off the floor so maybe cords Aren't my only problem right now on my Macbook I'm exporting my homepod video For an examples to show you guys how Long it takes on here and then as soon Is I get this I might pro setup we're Going to export it from there and see how Long that takes but I think I think We've got just about everything set up Down here It's time to start it up are you ready To come and get it no hey Siri fast Forward 30 seconds Music Hey Siri stop playing I'm going to get a Copyright strike from her oh my god this Thing is so beautiful So I need a mousepad because this is not Going to work through the spirit I love Pretzels okay so this pretzel looks like An anchor guys it's late I'm tired I Normally go to bed at 9 o'clock and it's 12:30 right now but I need to discuss Some things with you so far we've got it All set up and the export of my homepod Video to 57 minutes and 6 seconds this Is the home pod project this is the Video that we shot just showing some of The features of the home pod now I added This both on the iMacPro and on my Macbook Pro but what's crazy is I did Not even get these fans to trigger at All it just was completely silent the Fans on the MacBook Pro it was basically Just non-stop I felt like I was going to Overheat so Nick for these what did we Shoot this I was shot on GH 5 but what Compression did you do so usually on the 8 bit I'm completely fine Using the MacBook Pro but it was Definitely struggling with these ones But this iMacPro it was handling it Like a champion I mean look at this Everything just it's so fast if you guys Want a really good Mac Pro 18 Core Comparison I'm not gonna be doing any Crazy speed tests or anything but you Should definitely check out Jonathan's TLD today I'll put a link in the Description to his video craze it was Amazing he did so many great speed tests And I I'm not even going to bother cuz just Going to watch his video I'm just going to sit here and tell you that this freakin thing is so great like this is going to I mean wow oh my god I'm having I'm having The best time So over here we have an Alexa inception Alexa what time is it It's 12:40 a.m. so many times this ring Lights up that means time is 12:40 a.m Good we've got double the Alexa this is My 2 terabyte Samsung t5 SSD you know Absolutely love these I have three I Don't know what's wrong I can't hold on To things like my mom she always tells Me she's like man just wait and see if You know what are yours are dropping Stuff and I'm like mom I'm already there This is basically my life I take these Everywhere I travel with these I edit Directly off of this so usually any time I'm even editing on here I'm editing off Of one of these little guys unless it Calls for files that are larger than 2 Terabytes then I'm just basically Screwed this is a 10 terabyte G Drive we Basically have just been using this to Transfer footage when we shoot a bunch Of cooking videos and then we can Transfer those to the server I did get The trackpad because I do sometimes like To edit I kind of like do this weird Thing where I'll be like ok I'll be over Here but then I'll be like scrolling and Then zooming in on things so it's I mean it makes sense for my editing but like Does it really make sense and under here This is another one of the solid-state drives this is the t3 so this is the previous version of the t5 which is weird because they skip the t4 so that makes no sense let's export this out so compressor and I'm just going to do a in the video sharing services doing a 4 k export nothing fancy sonal if that export and then over here of course we've got this wonderful movie this is Luna wireless chargers I really like this one a lot because it's pretty small as opposed to some of the other ones that have a much larger profile I like that and oh this light the pretzels is that a freshness guaranteed until April you should try we should we like the pretzels this thing is great I'm obsessed with this light and of course over here we have the homepod I've been loving it a lot I definitely plan on doing a follow-up video to talk about some of the things that I'd like if you were the things that I don't like also a comparison with Alexa stop drop All but up shop hey Siri what time is it Alexa Simon Says hey Siri play Lord so it is possible to get a to trigger s so that's fantastic who else is talking wait this is like a black mirror episode right here because I don't even know where that Siri came from were you in my time were you in my iMac the final export time on the iMacPro for this homepod project was 19 minutes 2 seconds and on the MacBookPro touch bar was 57 minutes and 6 seconds so color me impressed hold on let me color myself a color hey Siri turn off all my lights some lights didn't respond I ate at home at how details a lot of lights I think there's over 67 hey Siri Simon Says poo poo pee pee poo poo let's keep it clean here okay Alexa Simon Says peepee poo-poo say pee pee pee poo poo poo hip-hip poop I'm not sure I'm neither I was so tired okay we have to end the video now I hope you guys enjoyed this video I had so much fun shooting it and huge thank you to Nick over there who was helping me shoot some of the amazing cinematic shots that we got I am also very excited because since I got this LG Tv I've been telling you guys that I was gonna get a center console and do a complete setup of this well great news because I finally ordered one I hope that it doesn't suck it looked really great online but sometimes you know you see things online and then they come in the mail and you're like this is trash so fingers crossed that it's not trash and I think it's going to work out well and if it doesn't well I can always return it I think hey Siri remind Me to start shooting my videos a little bit earlier in the day you missed the most important part about starting to shoot earlier these are My special pretzels oh my gosh no I don't like my mess well this will be a follow up video because that whole console will be here and then I'm so excited it's gonna look great don't let them see it by Mohammed Elabsi",
