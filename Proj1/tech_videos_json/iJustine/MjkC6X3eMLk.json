    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going? Today we are heading off to the desert for what I am calling a tech retreat. Yes, of course, the dog's coming with us. And I'm calling this a tech retreat because I'm basically packing up all of my drones, some of my cameras, and we're going to the desert to update firmware. I know, it's completely absurd. (slow synthesizer music) Jenna, we're going for a day. I've got five drones in this backpack, one phone, two phone, one of these phones has some beta software for something secret on it. One knife, two knife. - [Jenna] I have a knife too. - Oh yes, that's one of my favorites actually. - I have mini knife, just in case we lose all of the other knives. - [Justine] Matty's coming too, oh my gosh, does he look handsome. Should I get another wine? - [Jenna] Yes. - [Justine] What should we bring, a red or a white, oh, we only have two whites left. We'll bring this one. A sauvignon blanc. - [Jenna] Yes please. - [Justine] Jen's driving. - Yes. - [Justine] Thank you. - We're going on a road trip, woohoo! - Oh my, this is dirty, wow. Starbucks now has a blonde espresso roast which I am obsessed with of course I would say that I'm obsessed because that's what a basic girl does. Thanks for driving because I drove to Vegas on our first ES, and that was a lot of driving. Not sure if I had a good time or not. - They weren't here to witness what happened on the way home. - [Justine] Oh my God! - Because wow. - There's a setting in my car when you're doing cruise control that has lane assists, it'll basically drive for you, not like the Tesla will, but it will do, like, small turns and stuff like that, but one of the things is it will detect if it thinks that you're falling asleep. And I'm such a bad driver, that I wasn't falling asleep, but it thought that I was so it kept yelling at me and blinking it says take a break! Take a break! Four and a half hours of that. - [Jenna] Beeping, it's been a while. - Let's start up the RX Zero, I talked about this thing so many times, it's a yes. (soft country music) We've got about an hour left to go, but we have to go to the bathroom really really really bad because Jenna drank all that drink. We've only been driving for about an hour and we've already made two stops at Starbucks. We had to go to the bathroom, and we also decided to get some pumpkin bread. Where's Jenna? Oh this is a problem, she's not here. Look at this focus. iPhone 10 focus, incredible. Hey bud! No, Matty! He just ran out. - [Jenna] Where? - [Justine] The door, like, ran out the door! I opened to get a shot and he just-- - [Jenna] What's wrong with you? I closed it-- - [Justine] He ran so fast. We've got a nice little living room, Jenna's room, bathroom, my room, kitchen, and a nice little fenced-in yard for Matty to play. So I got us some shampoo and conditioner on Amazon Prime and I thought it was travel because it had these little pumps but those little pumps on top must have meant that it is basically an entire gallon. 33.8 fluid ounces for two days. - [Jenna] Breakfast is being made. - Good morning from Joshua Tree, we're making breakfast. All of those plans that we had to fly drones and update drones, basically, you know, this tech retreat has turned into a relaxing retreat and we're gonna go hiking. We're basically not gonna do any of the things that we planned on doing. Hey Siri, play me some music! - [Siri] Let's kick things off with Please Don't Go by Mike Posner. Let's run away - [Justine] Love Mike! (slow synthesizer music) Okay, I've got two waters, enough snacks, got our camera. I was excited because I was like, we're gonna be in the middle of nowhere, there won't be powerlines around by the house so I can just go outside, test the drone. There's a powerline right over the top of the house, so I don't want to fly that close. So we're really, we're just gonna go on a hike and enjoy the rest of Joshua Tree. - [Jenna] That's the airflow. - Okay. Wow. So while we were driving here, we just saw on Twitter that I was nominated for vlogger of the year, which is so crazy, because in this past year, I actually stopped vlogging. I have been vlogging for a very, very long time. In the past year I decided that I was gonna kind of stop vlogging. I cut back, I still do vlogs. I'm vlogging right now, but for the most part, I focused a lot more on tech, a lot more on cooking videos, and then in between, I would fill in with vlogging. It's kind of ironic that I basically quit doing the thing that I was really known for. And my channel became way more successful than it had in the previous years and now I'm nominated for a vlogging award! I'll take it! That's pretty awesome! If you guys want to vote, I'll put a link in the description where you guys can check it out. That's probably the last time that I'm gonna say to vote because I hate spamming you guys to vote for things. So with that being said, I'm probably not gonna win, but look at me, I'm vlogging! (soft synthesizer music) - [Jenna] Justine and Jenna have only gone 3.7 miles - I've only gone 0.32 - On their journey to the 49 Oasis Palms. - Jenna's doing the voiceover for Planet Earth. - Hey, BBC, hit me up! - Hit her up! We haven't gone very far at all. - No, no you have not. (soft guitar music) - Whoa! Ow! Oh, I got pinched by something, ow. - [Jenna] What do you think happened there? - I don't know. Wake up from the sunshine on my face So dehydrated don't know what to say There it is, we're almost there! We are 1.28 miles in, it's taken us 62 minutes, we're almost to the palm trees, it's called 47 Palms? - 49. - Going back is gonna suck 'cause this is all uphill. - Like, you want us to go up there. - Oh boy, alright. Mine's not loading. - [Phone Voice] You win the game, and you win money. Real money! - [Jenna] Owen! Ugh. - Trying to play HQ Trivia in the middle of nowhere. Mine's not working! Maybe if we get to the palms faster, we'll have reception. - [Jenna] What do you mean, we're going nowhere? - I don't know. I see Scott! Oh, it went away, okay, I give up. With a feeling in our hearts Felt like we're hiding our own We were dancing in the dark We were dancing in the dark Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh oh Okay we're heading back. We've got about two miles back, took us almost an hour to get over here, maybe a little more. I'm gonna put my camera away because it's heavy and I don't wanna carry it on the way back. Into the backpack you go, little guy, big guy. I know I only have myself to blame For drinking way too much I guess I got caught up Can someone make this headache go away - Oh, here he is! There's our baby! - [Jenna] Hi Matty! Oh, I tripped. - Wow wow wow, did you miss us? Did you miss us honey? Come on, let's go outside, let's go run around. Let's go run around on the yard. Oh is he spinning! Back up, back up. Oh my gosh. Yeah bud. Go Matty go! Come here, come here, see us, see, oh my God. - You're my lap dog. - Well that does it for my tech retreat. I did absolutely nothing that I had planned on doing. I was gonna update all the firmware on all of my cameras, all of them were on all of my drones, and guess what I didn't do. I did nothing. I drank wine, I painted, I watched Arrow. Ate a bunch of Butterfingers, we went on a hike - Basically everything we do in L.A. - Yeah, but I had a really great time. This house was incredible, Matty was a good boy and this looks really dark for some reason, but oh well. - [Jenna] Because it's dark in here. - [Justine] No, like this is something's not right. Oh well, see you later! (soft guitar music)",
