    "transcript": "- I'm iJustine and my life completely revolves around technology. We're preparing my order, so they'll email me when it's ready for pickup. And not only does my life revolve around tech, so does my YouTube channel. (upbeat rock music) There's everything from unboxing videos. So let's open it up. I do get a little reckless when I'm out flying. Reviews of some of my favorite products. This is something that I think that you will enjoy. And some that don't work so well. Oh my god! (beeps) It's terrible! - [Jenna] Justine! - Would you mind starting all of your questions with saying like, I, Justine. And then ask the question. - Yes. - [Justine] Say hi to the internet. - Hello internet. - Hi! Hanging out with Kevin Bacon, and you're promoting a new film Cop Car. - Cop Car. - iJustine, everybody. (audience cheering) Not only is Justine now a model on the show, but she was actually on the show once, weren't you, Justine? - I was and I won the showcase, so best of luck to all of you guys. (audience cheering) (light electronic music) I'm also a huge fan of video games. Ugh, this game makes me so happy. This is my Xbox that I made with my very own two hands and a computer, and a mouse, an illustrator. We're playing Mario Kart now. (Justine laughs) I also make cooking videos. - Look at this. - A vintage Apple. No, no, no, no, no! Oh geez! Stop! Sort of cooking. And when I'm not failing at baking, I'm traveling. I even wrote a book talking about my offline and online adventures. Finally here in Chicago for my signing, I'm so excited to see you guys. - [Fan] I love you! - I love you too! (fans cheering) Cheers to the future, technology is incredible, and so is pizza. Bye.",
