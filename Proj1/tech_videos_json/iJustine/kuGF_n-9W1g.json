    "transcript": "- Hey, guys! How's it going? It's Justine. Welcome back to my kitchen. And today we are making something very, very exciting and I'm going to try extremely hard to make this perfect. Now, if you guys are new here, most of the things that I bake in my kitchen don't usually end up well. But today, I am going to be baking a HomePod cake. Today's video is in celebration of the launch of the HomePod. I've made a few videos about it already: I did an unboxing and a really cool demo of it. I'll put links in the description if you wanna check those out. So, to get in the mood, I'm gonna start off with a beautiful soundtrack by the one-and-only, Hey Siri, play some DMX! This (beep noise) is mine (Beep) Oh god; (beep) It's not censored! Siri, stop - Hey, Siri! Oh god! Help! - [Siri] I can do lots of things. Try asking, \"Hey Siri! Spell the word 'entrepreneur'.\" \"Hey Siri! What does 'happenstance' mean?\" or \"Hey Siri! Translate 'This is delicious' into Chinese.\" (Beep) - One of the things that I will say about the HomePod, that I absolutely love, is it can hear you from pretty much anywhere that you are in the room. Even when you have the volume at max level. Anyway, we're here to bake a cake so just - I gotta, I gotta get the cakes. I've already baked them. (cake pans sliding and hitting one another) So the first thing that we need to do is we need to level off these cakes. I'm thinking that I can probably get by using three of them. Hey Siri! What do you think of me? - [Siri] I really couldn't say. - Okay, probably better you don't. (cheerful upbeat music) Okay... Okay, that's not level. Ugh, why am I not good at this? We're getting down to the nitty gritty. Who says that? Scott of HQ Trivia. That is so perfectly level. I cannot get more level than this, actually, I probably could but it's good enough. On ya go! We're applying the first layer here, so this is how we're gonna connect this all together. It's like a little bit of glue. (cheerful upbeat music) Play some party music. - [Siri] Oh, I love being party to a party. Here you go. (Justine laughs) (party music begins playing) - Is this Pitbull? Hey Siri, who is this? - [Siri] This is Fireball featuring John Ryan. I tell her baby, baby, baby, I'm a fireball (Fireball by Pitbull feating John Ryan) - Man, I really wish that I wasn't gonna get a copyright strike. Hey Siri, stop playing. (cheerful upbeat music resumes) So I'm having a little bit of a problem 'cause I'm afraid that this is gonna fall over 'cause it is definitely starting to tilt. So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna jam these knives into this and hopefully this'll help stabilize it, so note to anybody that's like \"Wow, I really wanna take a big bite of this cake\" Mm, you should probably be very, very careful. Hey Siri - - [Siri] Uhuh? - I think that you're my best friend. - [Siri] Sorry, I don't understand. - Yeah, fine. I don't understand either. That's holding up nicely. So, we finished one container of icing already. If anyone's like, \"Justine, what'd you do this weekend?\" Oh, I just made a HomePod cake. Hey Siri, what do you think about being a HomePod? - [Siri] I think, therefore I am. But let's not put the cart before the horse. - Okay. (cheerful upbeat music) So we are gonna be covering this in fondant, so this doesn't have to look perfect, but I do sorta want it to be as smooth as possible 'cause I am gonna be putting another layer on it after we take it out of the fridge. (fondant drops) This is gray fondant and I am beyond impressed at the incredible color match. This almost looks exactly like it. So now I gotta roll this thing out. Hey Siri, play Rollout! (Rollout by Ludacris) Rollout! Rollout! (cheerful upbeat music resumes) - Wow, I'm extremely impressed with my fondant rolling skills. This is probably the thinnest fondant that I've ever rolled. I know, guys. Get hyped. So, one of the key things that I'm trying to replicate on this HomePod is that it has this incredible mesh covering. So, how do I duplicate that here? I got some of this burlap garland, 20 feet, six meters - I dunno, I was at the craft store, I'm, like, \"Jenna, we gotta find some burlap.\" This is definitely not sanitary so if you think I'm gonna do a taste test after this: I'm not. Okay, so this smells very bad. (sniffs) Oh my - this is poison! Smell this. You gotta smell this. (man mumbles question) Just do a quick smell. - Whoa! - Wow! - Ew! - Death. Let's hope this works. So, we're gonna lay this here. And do a little roll. (cheerful upbeat music) Okay, so we're gonna add a second layer of icing to this before we apply this fondant, put this back in the fridge for a few more minutes, and then we're gonna just cross our fingers and hope that this all works out. (cheerful upbeat music) Guys, we're having some issues. I put too much powdered sugar on here now and this is sticking to - no... I've absolutely no idea if this is gonna work. But we're gonna try it. Oh, hmm... Oh, I rolled this fondant so thin. I don't know if this is gonna work. As long as one side is covered. Oh no, it's definitely - (Justine laughs) What? No! Oh my gosh! This is not what was supposed to happen! (Justine screams) Look, we can fix this. We can fix this; it's fine. Everything's gonna be totally fine. (Justine groans) Like, this is not anything that I had pictured at all. This is absolutely disgusting. I am so upset. And if anyone says \"Justine, didn't try hard enough\", like, I actually don't think that I could've tried harder. Do you think this is funny? - [Man] Sorry? - Because I'm going through some things right now. Now that it's already falling over - So, I need to prop this up a little more. I'm gonna jam this fondant. So, from this angle, it almost looks acceptable. Trim around this bottom a little more. I can't believe how bad this looks behind. Like, it looks so terrible. I think I'm gonna need to have a professional make me a cake for my HomePod party that I plan on having because this is not acceptable. My friends would expect this from me but this is not the quality that I'm going for. (rolling) Okay, what size do we need? Oh. The big one. Okay, there we go. Oh, look at your little hat! (Justine laughs) Oh, there's a hair on that. Oh, that's disgusting. So something that I wanna do - because this is very shiny - I have this clear piping gel that looks like this; it's gross. Just give it a nice sheen It is almost identical. So as you guys can see here, this is my HomePod cake, and this is the HomePod. You can see some slight similarities as far as the color and that's about it. Hey Siri, do you know who iJustine is? - [Siri] Justin Ezarik is an American YouTube personality, host, actress, and model. She is best known as iJustine with over 955 million views across her YouTube channel since 2006. - Oh, wow! - [Siri] That is from Wikipedia. Would you like to hear more? - No, but am I gonna approach a billion views soon? 'Cause if that's the - - [Siri] I think the answer to that - - Oh, I wasn't talking to you. I was just - I was talking to, yeah. Apparently, I'm a host, actress, and a model. So, that's some new information. Thank you guys for watching. If you wanna watch my unboxing of the HomePod or a demo of the HomePod, I've got those videos below in the description. And I'm sorry my spirits have went from here to here, like, I started from the top and now I'm at the bottom. Drake needs to write a song about me. Play \"Started from the bottom now I'm here\". (Started From The Bottom by Drake) Started from the bottom Now we're here Started from the bottom now the whole - That's it, I'm done. I'm defeated. It was a nice attempt. I'm so sad. This looks so stupid. - [Man] I love that you (mumbles). (cheerful upbeat music)",
