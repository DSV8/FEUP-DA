    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and I am so excited because (inhales) my first app is in the app store and it is an app to teach you guys to edit. So I'll put a link in the description where you guys can check it out. I worked with Ripple Training on this and they are like the leader in creating training courses specifically in Final Cut so I'm so excited to show this to you. If you guys do get the app make sure you rate it five stars and leave it a nice review so more people can find it in the app store. I have been editing for such a long time like since 2005. This is one of my first YouTube videos I know, it's weird but I actually shot this because I needed some footage to teach myself how to edit. You can see that I'm on Final Cut on my MacBook but I'm also using Avid in the computer behind me when it's like why are we using Avid to edit the things that we're doing. So I took it upon myself taught myself Final Cut then one of the best parts about this training course is I actually give you guys all of my footage so all of the footage that I used to create this actual YouTube video, you guys have it and you can edit right along with me. It's also really great because this app works in Final Cut so if it's a Final Cut extension so basically you can be editing in Final Cut with the footage that I have supplied you and never actually leave Final Cut. So Ripple Training and I have partnered together and we made this really fun tutorial of what I do from start to finish. Now here's a quick preview of what we created. Now drag to the right and you'll get visual feedback on the right side of the viewer to see exactly where that clip will start. There's also some transitions and I'm gonna tell you right now that my favorite transition is bloom and I overuse way too much but I love it. So let's take this middle section and click right at the edge and drag it. This action speeds up the center portion of the clip. (upbeat music) Now that you've added the presets in the viewer window is available. So on the left side you can see what it was like before and the right side is what it looks like after the compression is added. One of the things that I personally learned while working on this was using multi-cam clips. I used them previously but I have never used them consistently and for me I am always shooting with two camera setups. So this was something that I worked on really hard to make sure that we include it in this project because now editing in multi-cam clips in Final Cut is so easy. So if you are shooting with multiple cameras and separate audio, this is honestly something that everyone should be using. I am so excited for you guys to check this out especially if you are new to editing or if you have been editing for a while I promise you there will be something in it that you learn. If you guys enjoy the app make sure you guys leave it five stars and also leave it a nice review that way more people can find it in the mac app store. I am so excited I opened up my computer and I was like (loud inhale) it's featured on the app store. I couldn't believe it it was like a dream come true so thank you guys so much for letting me live my dream and create content with you and now let me give back to you and let me teach you my ways and a huge thank you to Ripple Training for working on this with me because we went every step of the way. They helped me create the courses, they basically like watched me edit a video and then we took that and broke it down into what would be the lessons, how were we gonna make this into something. So a huge thank you to them they also have a bunch of other really great courses too. So I knew going into this that us creating this together was going to be awesome. So once you guys have completed my course go check out some of their other ones because honestly if you are looking to learn Final Cut they do it in such a way that is so natural and I love the Final Cut extension, I mean you can basically be editing long in Final Cut. You guys have any questions feel free to tweet me I will also be in the comments below so I hope that you guys enjoyed this and I hope that you learned to edit and of course feel free to share your creations with me. I look forward to seeing what you guys make and that's it. Happy editing",
