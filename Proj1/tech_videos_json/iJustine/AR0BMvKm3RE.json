    "transcript": "- Here's the thing, I'm in the Southern Hemisphere. So I don't even know if this is gonna work. I don't even know if I'm gonna be able to enjoy the Summer update. There it is. Thinking of swimming? Yes. So, first things first, you wanna put on a suitable wet suit like mm-hmm, snorkel mask, let's replace... Oh my God, look at me, okay. (Justine gasps) Look at my little leggies, I'm freaking swimming. Get that. Could today get any more pearl-fect? Absolutely not. This swimming is very slow. (Justine gasps) Wow, we did it. Oh my gosh, I'm a swimming champion. So you can't get out on the rocks though. Here we go. Oh, we're going to try it again. Now, it's a little disappointing. Here we go to save the day. Oh shoot, okay. So one out of three? (water splashing) Right before you get there, you hit a... (Justine gasps) Hey, Pascal, what do you want? You could have anything. Wait, you better give me something. Stick that in your skillet and let it simmer. I think that Pascal is delusional. I'm a little concerned. Mermaid wall. Go get all the stuff I need. Go get all the stuff. I'm into it, but like I want an item. A sea slug, I'm kind of salty about that. Wow. Wow. (water splashes) Oh, hello sea star, maybe it'll give me an autograph. Can I catch? I can't catch meteors in the water, you should be able to catch meteors in the water. This is an oyster. Ooh, a whelk. What is a whelk? (Justine gasps) What are you doing? Let's freaking swim guys. We're swimming, we're gonna swim until our little leggies can't swim anymore. Oh, we got a scallop, mm-hmm, scallop. Okay, how about this? Wee! (clapping hands under water) You can clap in the water. This is a big boy. What are you, fast little dude. Come here, come here, come here. It's going so fast. Stop swimming you pig. So maybe if I just keep going and swimming here I'll swim ahead of it, and then I dive. Oh my gosh, it's so fast. Oh my God, now you're going this way. This is so cruel. This is ridiculous. I'm gonna drown. Now I'm gonna lose track of where it's going. Turn around every now and then I kick my little leggies I will not give up on this. 'Cause I need you now more than ever I'm gonna drown out here. What is happening? This is making me really furious. Like I'm trying to get ahead of it. Oh my God, we're so close, we're so close, so close, so close. Come on, this is insane. Like I can't freaking catch this thing. Oh my God, I was going this way. We got it, we got it, we got it, we got it, we got it, we got it, we got it, we got it. Snow crab, snow crab. That crab is ridiculous. I'm not keeping scallops for him. Oops, I'm sure I'll catch another. We gotta find some more scallops because I have messed up and sold them and if Pascal pops up... Oh look, I caught a scallop. (Justine groans) The fork is right here. I mean, I'm not really picking up any hobbies. I mean, I guess, is streaming a new hobby? I mean, this is... Okay, this is hurting, this is hurting. It's stuck in my hair now. It's pulling my hair. Oh no, this is really not good. Please be perfect, please be perfect. We're gonna close the game, bye. I just don't know how I've made it this long without like listening to K-pop. What did you guys send me? A leaf-print wet suit. Oh my God, look at my outfit. And I got a golf bag. This is great, we're going golfing. I missed the snorkel. Oh, that's cool, that's nice. He's a snow crab, because you know why? (upbeat music playing) Well guys, thank you so much for watching. I hope that you enjoyed the stream. I always have such a fun time with you guys. You're all awesome. And now I'm gonna see if any of my friends are on, that we can raid. (upbeat music playing) I ain't ever been a dreamer Always made me colder I don't plan to be a savior Let 'em know I was chosen",
