    "transcript": "- I can solve the cube, can you? It's actually quite easy. The first step is, we're gonna create a daisy. You can really call it whatever you want. I'm gonna call it the, get outta my business. Now we're gonna match up these top edges and put them to the bottom. Duh. Now we need to solve this entire bottom layer. It's so easy that even like a child could do it. Sometimes I just say a word and they form sentences and they make sense. The bottom's solved. Now I gotta solve the middle. This is not a speed cube. Middle layer, done. Now I need to get a yellow cross up here. This cube is so freaking slow. Turn and I turn and it doesn't happen. Okay, it happened. We've got to match up all of these crosses to have the same color. I do a couple more algorithms. Just let me live my best life, and there we have it. The crosses are now complete. We gotta match the corners now. Ugh, don't wanna be bothered, but here we are, I'm being bothered. Corners match, great. This is where we just complete the cube. This is how we do it. It's not even a Friday night, and here we are, done. Call me.",
