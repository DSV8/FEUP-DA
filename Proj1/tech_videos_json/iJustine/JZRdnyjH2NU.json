    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today we are checking out the brand new Sony Master Series A9F OLED TV. It is right here, it's in front of me. I'm excited because my sister and I actually got a chance to see this at their New York Launch Event a few months ago, and since then I have been waiting very very patiently. So today is the day where we actually get to unbox it and set it up right here behind me. Sony wanted to create a TV that preserved the creator's intent. So I make videos for a living, so when I am editing something and I see it on a different screen or TV, it's normally not exactly how I intended it to look. So that happens a lot with movies or TV shows, but with this it'll give you a perfectly calibrated view of exactly what the person who created it wanted you to see. So let's test this out. Let's get a knife! - [Jen] Here, catch! - Oh that's not funny. - I think I might need your help, Jen. - So this is the 65 inch, and it is going to look so beautiful. There may be a little bit of construction that we have to do, Jen. - [Jen] Is that why you made me come over? - Yes. (laughs) - [Jen] You said we were gonna watch Netflix. Perfectly calibrated. - I told you we were gonna watch Netflix but, not yet. Oh no there's more back here! - Alright, ready? - Okay let's move this over here. We've got more cables. This is the stand. Child safety. We don't have children. This is a nice piece of cardboard. This is what you put on the back because the cool thing about this is there's a center speaker, so when you're listening to the audio it's actually coming straight through the TV as opposed to at the bottom or from the sides. You're hindering my ability to see the TV. Okay put it down. Oh, yeah that's, that's the ticket! We're still here. Are you zooming in on help? (Jen laughs) So once we get done setting this up, we are gonna wait until it gets dark so we'll be able to have a really great test environment. Actually we just want to go to dinner first, oh yeah that's why. (laughs) But, it is gonna be a nice test environment. (laughs) Let me just rest, let me just rest for a moment. It looks pretty good. - It does look good. - Wow. Here's the problem, there's a lot of cables back here. Yes what's that? Is it HDMI? - Yeah. - I'm gonna feed you another one. How many more HDMI slots do we have left? - I think we used three. - Yeah there's another HDMI over here. This is lovely. Oh, yeah. She's ready! Maybe we should clean up first. - [Jen] We should go to dinner first. - We made a really big mess. Maddy, hi. Well I think we're finally ready to watch TV. Look at all these stickies, oh yeah. Oh yeah get it. Yeah. Oh wow. We've got everything set up and now the first thing that we have to do is test out the Netflix calibrated mode. What should we watch? This is all you wanted, was to watch Netflix. - [Jen] Yeah what do you want to watch? - Finally. Lost in Space, let's click it. Action menu, we're good to go to picture adjustments, clicking Netflix calibrated do you see it? Are you ready? Turn off all my lights. It also looks good from almost any angle too. Wow wow wow wow wow wow this is so exciting. Like, look, I can be over all the way over here. It's so crazy because usually I'm so used to having like a soundbar, and with no soundbar it still sounds incredible. It's so weird because the audio is coming from the center of the television. Which is such a strange thing. (dramatic music from the TV) It sounds like this whole room has surround sound and it does not. It's just coming from this. Sound good? (dramatic music from the TV) So like I was saying the audio is in the center of the television. The sound is basically traveling through the TV to me, right here. It's called acoustic surface audio plus. This thing is pretty awesome I like that there's no stand that you can see it's kind of just like hidden in the back. But the stand doubles as a subwoofer. The glass is actually the speaker, and three actuators cause the screen to vibrate to project sound from different parts of the screen. So the audio really does feel like it's coming at you. So all of this is made possible by Sony's new 4K HDR Processor called the X1 Ultimate. It has three major features; object based HDR remaster, dual database processing, and super bit mapping 4K HDR. And I know this can be a little bit technical but what this really means for you guys at home, is that you get an incredible realistic viewing experience. The object-based HDR though is really fascinating. It analyzes each object and each scene individually, and it'll enhance the color and the contrast so that the darks get darker, the whites get brighter, and everything is incredibly accurate to real life. Let's take this thing for a Fortnite test. I'm excited because now PlayStation has finally allowed crossplay between all platforms so you can play against everyone. Thank you, PlayStation. This is the first time that I've played Fornite on PlayStation. The boss is leaving! I'll thank the bus driver. No swimming? Okay. Now they're gonna find you. It doesn't even matter. This gun sucks. (gun firing) I'm gonna go get this person. Which I probably shouldn't because I don't have a good gun. Well, that's Fornite, and it looks freaking fantastic. I don't want to stop playing but I've gotta continue my video. We watched some TV, we played some Fornite, let's watch a movie. I watched like so many seasons of Arrow back to back, that I was concerned about my wellbeing. Oh yeah can you turn our light off? Oh, wow! - [TV] Received a vision from the Panter Goddess, Bast, who led him to the heart-- - I'm still so shocked by this audio, like it sounds incredible. I'm gonna fast forward to some action. It also has built in Google Assisted so you can basically talk to your TV. Hi, how can I help? Oh no, I was reading what you were saying, to me. I was reading what you were saying to me! Results for hi how can I help, wait, Nickelback? iJustine. So this TV is running Android O. The previous version was Android N and I have another Sony TV that is in my kitchen and it is a lot slower than this one so I've already noticed that this version os Android is so much faster. So that is really great news. (laughs) This was such a fun video. (uplifting music from the TV) I'm so excited I'm watching my own movie on my own TV. Thank you Jenna for helping me with this TV. I enticed her by telling her that we were going to be watching Netflix. - [Jen] And dinner. - And dinner. And guess what, we did both of those. If you want more information about this TV I will put a link in the description and I'll see you guys later 'cause I'm gonna finish watching my own YouTube videos. It's like I haven't ever seen my videos before. CES felt like such a long time ago. - [Jen] Let's watch Netflix I don't wanna watch you. - Okay. (playful music)",
