    "transcript": "- Today we've got a bunch of new Apple Watch bands, they recently released a bunch of colors for springtime, so I picked out a few of my favorite colors, and here they are. So let's open these up, try them on, and I'll do a little watch band fashion show for you guys. Which one am I gonna open up first is the question? I've been so into the sport loop bands, it took me awhile to get into them cause I was really into just the regular sport band, the first time that I tried this and actually went to hot yoga class with it I was like, \"this is amazing, like it's not sticking to my arm.\" But I did mention this in a different video, that it does get pretty disgusting, so I just throw it in the washer with my clothes. And then I play this fun game of, where's my Apple Watch band when I'm doing laundry. It's really fun, it's great, you guys should try it. Alright, I'm gonna open up the purple one first. Because purple is one of my favorite colors. Oh yeah this looks incredible. The thing is with the gold, it's sometimes hard to find colors that look good with it, which isn't a thing that I thought until I basically put every single Apple Watch band on and they all looked really good, so maybe it was just something that I was thinking in my mind. Have I sweated this thing into oblivion? Oh yeah purple doesn't look bad. What a nice complement. Oh man, there is nothing like a fresh and clean Apple Watch band. This looks really good I love it. So this is the lilac sport loop, gosh I love the sport loops, they're so soft, it almost doesn't even feel like you're wearing a watch anymore. I love my Apple Watch so much. Although, I don't know if this has happened to you guys, but I wear my Apple Watch so tight that like my arm is indented. I guess that's just a part of my body now. Papaya sport loop, coming up next. Wow. Does look like papaya. I mean there is not a better name that they could have come up with this, actually maybe like tangerine or orange crush, or what is, is it like, orange sherbet? Oh yummy. I think I like the lilac with the gold a little bit better, but this definitely makes a statement, like hello, I am here. Like if you were crossing the street or something it's like a construction color orange. This is something that I definitely, I think, would wear when I'm going out, like to the club. Like, hello! Hello! I don't go to the club, but if I did, this is what I would wear, I would probably wear this ripped sweatshirt as well. Papaya sport loop, looking good. Did I mention how much I love my Apple Watch guys? I use it basically everyday, I think almost every, definitely have had this one on almost every day since I got it. Next up we've got the spearmint sport loop, looking super minty. I think the mint might actually complement my iPhone case the best. It's the pink sand, it's the new charging case. I'm so excited for this one, this one might be my favorite. I haven't even seen it yet, oh yeah. This looks good. I do like the papaya, but I feel like this isn't gonna match that many things. These colors all look so good together. The green looks really good with the gold as well. Spearmint in. I can't decide which one I like the most. I do think so far I like the spearmint. I really like the lilac. This is a problem. That looks so good. Who are you wearing? I'm wearing spearmint sport loop. But right now, I'm gonna be wearing Apple Watch 40 millimeter lilac modern buckle. There are these little tabs all over my house. This is gonna be my first stainless steel buckle, I've never had one before. (gasps) This looks so good. Why have I not gotten one of these before? I just feel like, like that Little Mermaid song, like a whole new world, no that's Aladdin, A whole new world Is that Aladdin? I was thinking of Little Mermaid when she sings the song, gadgets and gizmos a-plenty, like I've got who-zits and what's-it's galore. This Apple Watch band has just opened up my eyes. Like I saw the sign. That's Ace of Bass, geez. Why have you guys been keeping this secret from me? Why has no one told me that modern buckle is freaking fantastic. Maybe I'd wear this to the club. I gotta go to the club. I wonder if they have a gold one. These are a lot of questions that I need to have answered. This just really did open up my eyes to a whole other look of Apple Watch bands. (dog bark) Maddie come here, look, I have something for you. Wanna see this paper? Come up here see it. No, okay. Moving on, we have two more. I haven't even used my knife this entire video, is something wrong with me? Ugh, spearmint is such a good color. Yeah I'm so ready with all these beautiful Easter colors. I'm gonna have to go sit on the Easter Bunny's lap. Which color should I wear when I go sit on his lap? Let me know in the comments below. The spearmint looks great with the gold. We've got one more. Jenna! - This is beautiful! Wait that purple one. - Have you seen the modern buckle? - No. This is a lovely lavender. - I know, it's lilac actually. - Lilac, lilac, that's the color. - So this is the last one that we have to try on this is papaya. - Do we have the same watch? How do I not know what watch you have? - No, I have the gold. - Do you... - But I have the same band. - You do have the gold. Okay, so if there's any that look better on my watch you can just toss em this way. Do you think you like your watch better, or your iPhone? That's a dumb question. - I need them, that is a dumb question. - I need them both to find each other. This is what I'll hear, all the time, (iPhone ring) and then I hear Justine (sigh). Just 100 percent guarantee you hear the (sigh), (mumbling through laughter) - It's usually far away, sometimes, the best part is during like winter months or whenever it's like Uggs season I always forget and I put my phone in my boot. - In your boot, I do that too. - And then I have to find it. - Or I'll place it in my pocket, and I'm like where's my phone, I'm like ah it's on me. That looks nice, I like that with the gold. - I would say the biggest surprise out of all of these is how much I loved the modern buckle. - [Jenna] It's very cute. - Let me show you again. - [Jenna] Very fashionable. - I have never had one of these before, out of all of the Apple Watches that I've had over the years, and for however long they've had the modern buckle. - [Jenna] This isn't new? - Well the colors new, but the modern buckle style is not new. - I like that it's really thin. - I know, wow give me this, let me show you. I've got to show you this. You're gonna be so... - [Jenna] I really like these. - Shocked. Yeah, I know. - This is the color of my room at home. - It is. - That's how much I like that color. - I'll wear it today. - You can't wear all of these at the same time. Oh no, challenge accepted. - I think I might have enough Apple Watches to make it happen. - Weird flex but okay. - [Both] Whoa! - Why am I here that looks good. - I don't know, look at this. - I like that one. - I think I'm wearing this to dinner tonight. - I'll ask the waiter. - I'll have the salmon. I'll be like she'll have the salmon. - We can wear the salmon colors. - Give me a color. - What color, what color do you want? - Give me that one. - You want a spearmint sport loop? - Oh that looks, wow, hello. - So springy. - Spring called, they want their fashion back. I'll have the pasta. I'll probably have a ravioli. - Did you look at the menu? - I'll have french fries to start, no. - Did you look at the menu, oh no. I didn't either, there may be nothing for Jenna. - We're going to dinner tonight. - Jenna is a very picky eater, and every time I didn't look at the menu cause I did not choose the restaurant. - Oh, I'll have a pre-dinner, anyway thanks this is mine now. We keep each others things for so long that it's just like, this is mine now. - Yeah like that one shirt that I think you actually took back. - I did take it back finally, you had it for like a year and a half. - Oh probably even longer. - It's like, it's mine. - Well Jenna thank you so much for joining. - Oh my gosh thank you so much. - Great to see you, I mean, you haven't been here all day or anything. - No I was upstairs. - First time I saw you wow surprise. - This is for me now. - Cool. - Thanks. - Well let me know what you guys think of this new little area. We've been doing some rearranging. - A lot of things happening. - A lot is, alright, since I don't vlog anymore it's like you guys don't even know me. - You're not missing much I know her. - You're not missing anything, it's the same thing, I mean I sit around eat, play video games, play with the dog. - Hike, you go outside more. - I do other secret activities. - I vlog so you can come to my channel. - Go check out Jenna she vlogs. - Not as much. - Okay cool. - Bye. - Bye! - I'm gonna keep this, look how cool it looks. - Yeah but sport modern band modern buckle. - Whoa. Well that was something that happened. - I'm tired.",
