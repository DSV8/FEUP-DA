    "transcript": "- Oh my goodness. You guys, do you see all of these items? So this is going to be a video talking about the past few months, my experience with the iPhones and how much I'm loving them. But then I checked my mail and RhinoShield sent I think everything on their website, like abs... They just went to the website and shipped it to my house. So a huge thank you to RhinoShield for sponsoring this video. They have a bunch of amazing black Friday deals going on right now. And if you use iJUSTINE at check out, you can get an additional 10% off all of your purchases. So now it's time to show you guys some of this stuff. Like I'm so excited because I love accessories for my accessories. They have crash guards for your Apple watch, they even have cases for your air pods. They have various types of cases like the MOD NX, CRASHGUARD NX and the SOLIDSUIT. So what's cool is with this MOD NX, you're able to customize it with these different types of back plates. You can actually customize these with photos or text, your name, logo. Anything you want, you can put this on here. And if you didn't upgrade to an iPhone 12 this season, that's okay because guess what? They also have tons of different accessories for previous gen phones. So these are for the iPhone 11, drop tested 3.5 meters. Impact protection. Look at that. Military grade? Find me out on the iPhone battlefield. So when you pair one of your RhinoShield protective cases with the impact 3D screen protector, you're going to get so much extra protection. Enhanced durability. Now it's time to dress up my iPhone. What do you want to wear today, screen protector? I like this. It's a little brainstorm. A brainstorm. Cute. - [Voiceover] One, two, three. (upbeat music playing) - Okay. This is what I've picked. Oh, this is going to be beautiful. This is fashion everybody. What is this? What does the fox say Oh my gosh, I love this. Oh, this looks so good on the blue. So for my personal phone, I got the silver Pro Max. And this was one of my review units, but there is just something about this blue that I just... I almost wish that this is what I would have got for myself because it's so pretty. We're going to have a really great mix and match sesh right now. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. That's cool. I want to change out that color to be the blue. You've got so many options. It's overwhelming. Oh yeah. Look at that. That's cool. So if we want to have this on without a back plates we can have this cool little outer rim. Right now I'm going to match my Apple watch to it. I have never put a bumper on my Apple watch before. This. Oh, my fashion. Should also put on our 3D impact shield. The rest of this video might get wild. We just can't ever reach ashore. (upbeat music playing) Pop on my bumper. Look at this matching beautiful family. Now where's my apple watch band? That looks nice. Oh, this looks really good. I think I'm getting into Apple watch bumpers because like it completely changes the look of my Apple watch. It's nice. It's very light too so you don't actually feel any different. I'm going to clean up my desk a little before we continue with this video. So watch this. (snaps finger) (dramatic music playing) - It didn't go. - It didn't work. - It's still here. It didn't work. Let's try it again. Okay. Ready? (snaps finger) Wow. Look how clean this desk is. It's like magic. Thank you again RhinoShield for sponsoring this video. You guys are amazing. And if you guys want to check out anything on their website everything is 60% off right now due to those black Friday sales. And if you use iJUSTINE at checkout, you'll get 10% off as well. So many cases. So little time. Let's carry on. Now we need to talk about basically the last few months of iPhone season. I feel like this tech season has been absolutely never ending and I couldn't be happier because so many incredible things have come out. Not only have we had like nonstop waves of iPhones, we also got new Macs, we got new iPads. I have a new wrinkled shirt, but I'm just noticing now. (laughs) So dating all the way back to October, we were brought into iPhone season with the iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 Pro. And so it was really exciting because this was the first time that we really were able to get our hands on these devices and really see what they're capable of. And of course this entire year has just been so strange. So at this time it was the first time that I had traveled home to visit my family. And I had to bring everything with me. Like I had to bring lighting, I had to bring all of my cameras. I brought so much stuff across the country because I knew that if the iPhone was coming out, I needed to have everything to cover it. So it was really fun because I got to see my family but also I kind of worked the entire time. So I'm very sad that I had to do that. But this is also very big news. My sister Brie Ann who she's not really an internet person at all... - I can see stars in it. - I know. - It's like... - Are you impressed? - That looks, yeah, that looks like a picture frame. That's a nice picture. - Brie's impressed. - I'm impressed. - She has not bought her own iPhone in a very long time. I think that she had one of my other sister, Jenna's very, very, very, very old phones. Her and her husband both decided to officially upgrade to the 12 pro max. So it's really amazing because this phone, when you're jumping up from even the seven or the eight, I mean it is even a big difference from the 10. But that's where you're going to really see the difference because the iPhone 11, if you do have one, that camera system is so impressive. It's the first time that they integrated the three camera lens system with the ultra wide, the wide and the telephoto. But having this 12 pro and the 12 pro max add on that addition to the LIDAR plus the Dolby vision HDR, it does make a difference. And I've been enjoying editing HDR footage off of the iPhone so much. So while reviewing the 12 and the 12 pro I also got a chance to check out the mag safe charger for the first time, the mag safe wallet adapter, which is really cool. There's been so many people that have been making videos. Like it falls off your phone when you put it in your pocket. And then Peter McKinnon made a video showing like how are you putting it in your pocket? Like if you're putting it in your pocket trying to make it fall off, then yeah it's going to fall off. For me this is an accessory that I don't really want to use. I have a separate wallet and most of the time I only do Apple Pay. I really only carry like my ID and one credit card as a backup if Apple Pay isn't accepted. So doing this first review was really fun because I had so much incredible footage. We were actually in Maryland and it was right in the middle of fall. So all of the leaves have changed. So I was able to get some really cool footage. (upbeat music playing) So shortly after that Apple updated their clips app. So now you were able to edit really short clips in clips. You can now shoot vertical video. You can shoot horizontal, you can also do captions at the same time while you're recording a video. So this is a really cool feature if you want to add integrated captions into like your Instagram posts or even on Twitter. Then... I went out on a 5... GUW safari. So this is probably one of the most fun videos that I have made in a really long time because I got to sort of just be weird and be myself and just go out and try to look for 5G as if I was on a Safari hunt in some foreign land. But I was actually in Los Angeles. The best part about this video is something that I didn't even capture. I went into REI. So when I went to the checkout, the guy asked me what I was going to be doing with the binoculars. He's like, \"Oh, are you going to be doing birdwatching?\" I was like, \"No, I'm going to go hunt for 5G.\" He's like, \"Oh, okay. So like a parody or something.\" And I was like, \"No, this is all seriousness. I got to go find 5GUW.\" What was really cool is actually getting to experience these speeds. I've had 5G phones before, but a lot of times when I'm testing them out, you have to actively go and search for 5G because it is not everywhere. 5G is, but 5GUW, that's the ultra wide band and that's where you're really going to see those fast speeds. We also did a really fun 12 and 12 Pro camera test We went out to Palace Verdes which is one of my favorite places in Los Angeles to go and shoot and film because it's usually pretty secluded. And especially at a time like this where you don't really want to be around people. And even when you're filming, this was a perfect day. It was wild because as soon as we got there I was like, shoot, it started pouring down rain. and the second that we parked, like the skies opened up it was like this video was meant to be shot here. What we also did with this too is we put the 12 pro on a gimbal. So I have one of those little DJI Osmo mobile 4s. The stabilization already on this thing's pretty impressive. But when you pair this with that gimbal, I mean this footage looks like it's on a drone. I also got a chance to chat with Francesca Sweet who is an Apple executive and we talked all about 5G. So it was really cool to hear her kind of walk me through from Apple's perspective, what 5G means for them because every single iPhone is now 5G enabled. 5G, it's the future. So around this point, everyone started getting their phones and that's when it was time for the one more thing event. So Apple dropped this huge event announcing all of their new M1 max, which by the way completely just separate from the iPhone. These things are so fast. The M1 chip is just, I'm shocked. Now that brings us to the 12 Pro Max and the 12 Mini. I feel like I have been doing kind of all of the same sort of videos and unboxings the same way. So we decided to shoot like this really fun slow-mo montage of unboxing both of them. And this is really cool, but it took us a very long time to get all of these shots because we had to be very precise, the focus had to be perfect and we were shooting it in slow mo. So I had to either go very quickly at opening it but then I was going too fast and then we'd miss the shot. So this little intro montage took us a really long time, but it was really fun to shoot. (upbeat music playing) So for my 12 Pro Max and pro Mini video, I wanted to go somewhere and I basically only had one single day. So we decided to drive to Joshua Tree at it was like Thursday night, super late. We shot all day Friday, a little bit Saturday, drove back home, had to film some more and then Sunday edited all day and then posted the video on Monday. So a lot of these videos are very quick turnaround times. What was great though about shooting at Joshua Tree is we were really able to showcase like how good this dynamic range is when you're shooting outside. Being able to pull down the highlights in the sky so that you don't lose any detail. For me that's really important and when I'm editing, I really like to kind of turn down my contrast. I like to up the saturation. So I really like to have the colors pop and kind of have that contrasty look. I also got a chance to check out the mag safe duo charger. So this is kind of Apple's two in one charger for your Apple watch and the mag safe charger. So this is such a small, portable, compact a little charger that I wish that all of the times that I had been traveling last year that this was something that was out. But now I'm not really traveling as much anymore. So it just kind of sits on my desk. And it folds up so nice and cute, like, look at that. The thing that surprised me the most though about the iPhone 12 Pro Max is that telephoto. I really didn't think that two and a half times zoom was going to make that much of a difference until I tried it and put it side by side with the iPhone 12 pro. And I was like, wow, all right, you know what? This is... this is worth it. I love the form factor and the size of the 12 pro but I really just want that better camera system. So because it does have the censorship technology and the wide angle lens you are getting a much more stable shot in the pro max, as opposed to the 12 pro or the 12. I didn't think it was gonna make that much of a difference. But when you start looking for it, you see it. I shot a very fun photo and video camera test. So if you guys want to watch that full thing you can check that out. I basically tested out all four of the iPhones and kind of put them up side by side. And the thing that I noticed is all four of them take incredible photos and videos. But if you do decide to go with the 12, you're not going to have that three camera system like the pros. So you're only going to have the ultra wide and the wide angle. But the good news is you are getting Dolby vision HDR on all four of the phones. You are only able to shoot 30 frames a second on the 12s and on the 12 Pro you do get up to 60 frames a second. So if you do plan on ever wanting to slow down that footage then the pro is definitely the way to go. And also they released the home pod mini. I completely forgot about that. The thing is so cute. I feel like the home pod mini is perfect for smaller spaces. I mean, if you have an apartment or just like a small little shelf, like the home pod mini just looks so much better than the large version. And if you are in a smaller space, having that large home pod is definitely unnecessary. I've really been enjoying having those as a stereo pair. So I paired them with my Apple TV. So I've been using them kind of as my home theater system now. I guess last but not least even though this isn't iPhone related, I did do a pretty extensive review on the new M1 max for the new MacBook Air and the new MacBook and the Mac Mini. I did this really fun format where I kind of opened up my own, I guess, Mac Depot store. I do have some plans of kind of continuing that and making it more of a series. So be sure to look out for that. But if you haven't checked that out I will also put a link in the description if you want to see me as if I was at a genius bar except it's not. It's iJustine's virtual Mac Depot. I opened up a store in my house and let you guys virtually ask me questions. Well, thank you guys for watching. I just kind of wanted to recap everything that I've talked about for the past couple of months regarding the iPhone and Apple, because there's so much content. And so much tech has been coming out that it is incredibly overwhelming. Be sure to leave me some comments. I'm always reading those and talking to you guys. So I will see you in my next video, but until then I guess I'll see you in the comments. See you. (soft music playing)",
