    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine! And, today we're unboxing the brand new DJI Ronin-SC. This is a follow up to the previous Ronin-S, which I recently have just been using quite a lot for a bunch of the shots that we were filming in Montana. We use this thing a ton. I wish that we would've had this on this shoot because this thing is half the weight of the Ronin-S. And, the Ronin-S isn't even that heavy. I think it's like a little bit over four pounds, whereas this one is 1.1 kilogram. Hey (beep), how many pounds is 1.1 kilogram? - [Computer Voice] 1.1 kilograms is 2.43 pounds. - 2.43, this is less than two and a half pounds. So, enough talking, let's open it up because I need to show you guys how awesome this thing is. (upbeat music) So, the battery life on this is about 11 hours when it's fully charged, and the payload is two kilograms. Hey (beep), two kilograms is how many pounds? - [Computer Voice] Two kilograms is 4.41 pounds. - 4.4, okay, so this thing'll be able to handle most mirrorless cameras and smaller lenses. There's a complete compatibility list, so I'll put a link in the description if you wanna see if your lens and body is compatible. Most of the time, when I'm out using one of these things I'm not using a massive lens anyway. Probably the biggest lens that I would be using would be like the G Master 16-35 or the 24-72 Master, but honestly I probably would go with just a smaller lens to make my life much easier. So here are a few cables. So, these are what allows you to connect your Ronin to your camera so you'll be able to control the focus, and there is also a little focus motor here. And, this has these little grippy teeth, too. So, this will allow you to manually focus while you're shooting, but to be completely honest with you, I mostly shoot everything in Auto. Most the time, we're doing like run and gun shots. Rarely do we have time to just set up shots. This little handle also doubles as a tripod, which is nice. So, you can set your Ronin down. I mean, the other one, honestly was not heavy, but in comparison to this, this thing is so light. This is our little battery charging handle. Screw this handle into the bottom here. Moving on, this is what makes the magic happen. This has a mechanical lock for each axis. This is really great because you can basically set your balance, lock it. You can put this in your backpack or have it set for storage. The difficult thing with some of these gimbles is making sure that you're getting the balance correct. So, once you do have it set, the last thing you wanna do is continually be messing with it when you're on a shoot. So, let's put you right here. My gosh, this is so much lighter! This is, this is just crazy! So, here is what-- Oh my gosh, this plate is so small! This is big boy Ronin. Ronin-S. And, this is the baby. It's so much lighter. I mean it really is half the weight. You'll even notice this camera plate right here is so much bigger. Like, look at this. Obviously, the Ronin-S is made for bigger cameras, DSLRs with larger lenses, but most of the time, the stuff that we're shooting for YouTube, we're using mirrorless, we're using smaller cameras. I also like that this has this little slider, so you can have this set to where you want the camera when you're attaching it to the gimble. This makes it easy because you can just pop off the camera with the slider attached, and the camera will be able to go back in the same position when you slide it back on. So, this is pretty awesome. What else we have? Oh, so this is a little riser plate. So, sometimes if you're shooting on a camera where the lens hangs over the top of the camera, so you'll need to use something like this to raise the camera body up from the lens. This is the phone holder. So, this is kinda cool because there's a bunch of different ways that you can mount this onto the Ronin. You can either mount it onto your camera, or you can also mount it onto the side here. One thing that I first noticed is, obviously, the size of this case. It is so much smaller than the previous version. Let me show you. Oh, somebody went on a summer diet. How great. Okay, so let's get a camera on this thing and get it balanced. I'll put big boy away. It's so sensitive. (chill music) (upbeat music) Okay, we're in. Let's do a balance test! The tilt is excellent. The roll is excellent. The pan is excellent. I just can't even believe it. There's a few new mobile features, so you can connect your phone to the Ronin and you can do ActiveTrack 3.0. So basically you can be tracking your subject and also moving the gimble around. So, it'll be keeping that person or object in the shot. There's also a Force Mobile feature, so you'll be able to control the gimble using your phone. So, you can have one person controlling the camera while somebody else is either holding it and moving it around. So, there's a lot of really cool implementation that I really wanna try out with that. I wanna test out the Force Mobile. So when we activate Force Mobile, the gyroscope in my phone acts as a control for the gimble on the camera. Like, look at this. I feel like I am mother. I'm enjoying this way too much. I guess I'm gonna stop now. But, now I also wanna show you guys the 360 3-D roll. This was something that the Ronin-S made, these incredible 360 roll shots possible. So, you can also do that here. You do have to enable it inside of the app. So, let me enable it, and I'll show you guys what I'm talking about. (gasps) There it is! This is gonna be cool. (squeals) (laughs) Oh, yeah! (bouncy music) We're out and about to test out the Ronin-SC, and the first thing that I'm gonna tell you is you can hold a coffee and use the Ronin at the same time. I'm so basic it hurts. But, look at this. I'm so strong, or maybe this is so light. I don't know, oh. (chill music) This is also pretty cool. There's a virtual joystick mode when you go into the create menu. So, I can control the gimble with my phone. This would be really great if I had an external monitor attached to it. I actually just recently ordered a little attachment that you can hook onto here, so I can use the Ninja V attached to this. That hasn't come in, yet. But, when it does, I will do a follow-up video. This is really cool. This is Force Mobile. So, basically what this does is it turns my phone into being able to control the gimble. It's using the accelerometer and the gyroscope in this phone, and it is acting like the gimble controls. Do you know what we could do? We could be in the Olympics. Synchronized, what would we call it? Like synchronized swimming, but synchronized gimbling? (whimsical music) We could look left and right, move a little, oh there we go. Yes, that's great! Good job, Jenna! ActiveTrack 3.0 is so fun. The Ronin-SC comes with this phone mount. Attach your phone to the top of your camera. Get everything balanced, and in the app under the create section, you'll go into ActiveTrack. Once it's open, you will select your subject by drawing a box around them. Can you believe this? This is so cool. I mean, my phone is just attached to it. Thank you guys so much for watching. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I look forward to implementing more fun Ronin-SC shots. So far, using this thing has been so fun. I love it. It's so much lighter than the previous version. Man, if we woulda had this in Montana. - [Jenna] Oh my gosh! - [Justine] (gasp) It woulda been great! - [Jenna] Look at it tracking you. - [Justine] I know. - [Jenna] It doesn't even care about me anymore, makes me feel bad. - And, if you are using, like, heavier cameras and different lenses, then obviously the Ronin-S is something that probably would work better for you. But, for me, this is honestly everything that I've wanted. I'll see you guys later. Bye! Okay, it's okay. - [Jenna] Ahhh, you're-- - Ahh, I'm back! (snaps) - [Jenna] Bye! (whimsical music)",
