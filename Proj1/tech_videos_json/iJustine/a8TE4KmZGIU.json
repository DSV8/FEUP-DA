    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today we're checking out the Oculus Quest. Now I am so excited about this because I love VR, but I don't like the process to make a VR work, until now. With Oculus Quest, you don't need a PC, you don't need any wires, everything you need is right in the box. The experience of VR is so much fun just to transport yourself into another world. A huge thank you to Oculus for sponsoring this video. I have been looking forward to checking this out since it was first announced. Without further ado, let's unbox, check it out and then, I'm going to be going to E3 to be playing a demo of the 360 Beat Saber game. Believer (gasps) Pain You break me down You build me up Believer Dance Central, oh boy. I'm gonna be getting my workout in playing Oculus now. (gasps) Just like that. The packaging is really well done. It's super easy to set up too because everything again is in the box. It also comes with the touch controllers. This is what allows you to transport your hands into the game. That makes such a huge difference being able to actually see your hands, because it makes you feel like you're so much more in the environment. I love that it also has this feature called The Guardian. So that'll allow you to not run into things when you're inside of the world. Oculus inside tracking system is right here. So these are ultra-wide angle sensors. It provides room scale tracking without external sensors. It's like we've got a charging brick and this is a little extender, if you have glasses, this will allow you to wear glasses. Hmm, this is a longer USB-C cable. Got some batteries, those are for the controllers. Instructions, so little. I'll read that later. So the headset has built-in audio, so you don't really need a headset, but if you do want to wear headphones, there are two headphone jacks on each side. So there's one here and again right here. It's gonna kinda be surrounding you, so you'll be able to actually hear people sneaking up behind you or somebody in front of you or to the left or to the right. I think now is the time that we set it up. This slides off very easily. That's it. In you go. Do our setup. Oculus Quest, now this is gonna walk us through and I am so ready! It's updating, it's updating! I guess I'll head off to E3 to play Beat Saber 360, so I'll see you guys in, right now. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) We're about to go in the VR photo booth. These look really funky. (loud talking) - [Photographer] Move over to the center, so we're gonna do a few, don't worry, we can kinda work it out. - Oh, boy. - [Photographer] We're gonna slide you down, okay. Two, three! Nice! - So we're not going to be playing the Beat Saber 360 demo just yet. First, we need to get a photo for Instagram. (mumbling) - Maybe both. - Okay. - Jenna's on boom duty. (upbeat music) So now we're playing the demo. I'm so excited about this. It's really cool 'cause they have two different levels and they're both themed around Imagine Dragons songs. So you really think I should play on hard? - Yes ma'am. - Here we go. This is gonna be so fun. - Headphones in front of you. - Let's go. Okay, we're on hard. Oh my, it's going so fast! (bass music) What did you do to me? (upbeat music) First things first Ima say all the words - Oh my gosh, this is insane. I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been - No, I did it wrong. The way that things have been oh ooh - Oh my God, there is so much happening. Don't you tell me what you think-- - It's slowing down a little. No it's not, no it's not! You made me a believer - Ah! Pain You break me down, You build me up Believer Believer - Oh my gosh, it's a wall! Pain I let the bullets fly Oh let them rain My luck - This is incredible. They came from Believer Pain You break me down You build me up Believer But they never did Ever lived-- - What, no! There are so many walls! Till it broke open and it rained down It rained down Like Pain - Holy moly, you can't be, you can't be doing this. Believer Believer You made me a believer - No way, we're back. Oh gosh, the 360 is real. Pain I let the bullets fly Oh let them rain My luck, my love, my God They came from Pain You made me a, you made me a believer Believer - Oh my gosh. I did it. That was so fun. Okay let's do another one. Okay so I got a D. I think I might need to practice a little bit. Okay, Thunder. Leave my old life behind - So Thunder only has a hard option. - [Man] Yes ma'am. - Oh shoot, let's go. Oh my gosh. Just a young gun With a quick fuse I was uptight Wanna let loose I was dreaming of bigger things and - Oh my gosh, this is so fast. Nope. Not a yes sir Not a follower Fit the box Fit the mold Have a seat in the foyer - Oops! Take a number - Shoot. Ah Come on, I'm not doing well. This one is so hard. Thunder Thun-thun-Thunder Thunder - Oh my gosh. These walls are terrifying. Lightning and the Thunder Thunder Thunder Feel the Thunder Thunder Lightning Thun-thun-thunder Thunder Thunder Thunder, thun- - Oh my gosh, there are walls everywhere. Thunder - (gasps) Okay, so I definitely, didn't do as well as the last. I still got a D. That's not last in the alphabet. That was so much fun. Oh my gosh. I think need to practice a little bit. I'm sweating. Well thank you guys so much for watching, I had so much fun playing Beat Saber 360 game. It was honestly insane. Like if you guys have played the first one, this was like a whole nother experience. A huge thank you for Oculus for partnering with me on this video. I had so much fun. What I'd like to know from you guys is would you like to see me do more VR stuff, like should I get a green screen wall and really get crazy? Let me know in the comments below. I'll see you guys later. Bye. (upbeat music)",
