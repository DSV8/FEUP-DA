    "transcript": "- Oh, boy, we have got a mystery box, actually two mystery boxes. Now I already know that they're from Nintendo, because this one said, 'From Nintendo' and this one's a big mystery question, coin block. I don't know who else it can be from. Obviously it's Nintendo. So thank you Nintendo for sending me whatever is in here. I can't wait to open it up. Should I start with small box or big box? Small, big, I think I'll start with small box. Been a while since I've done just sort of a mystery unboxing. So today is the day. Oh, a note from Isabelle. It's an Animal Crossing fall activities, November calendar. And a note to say that the product has been provided by Nintendo. So product has been provided by Nintendo. Look at this, these are all of the activities that I can do. Oh my gosh, the month is almost over and I have not enjoyed all of the activities. Turkey day, this is gonna be awesome, the 26th. Okay, what's in here? Stickers, I love this game so much, oh my gosh! Is this a Tom Nook hat? What? (soft upbeat music) I think I'm gonna cry. This is something that I didn't know that I needed. Jenna? - No way. - I have a Tom Nook hat. - No, no. - I also got a little water bottle. - This is cute. - It's an insulated what... I'll put my coffee in this. Look at...Oh, wow. Look at this. What is that? Do I take that out? (thermos lid pops) - Oh. - Oh, I'm confu... What does this mean? All right, I wanted to show you my hat. - [Jenna] It's a very nice hat. - I know. Wow. Catch me on the Island. (gasps) Animal Crossing socks, like the socks that I'm wearing right now, are also (chuckles) from Nintendo. Oh my God, Tom Nook on my head and Tom Nook on my toes. Mabel, Isabelle, and Tom or Timmy or Tommy. Same really, I guess, same difference. Look at this... A little bag. My gosh, I'm so excited. I love this game so much. It honestly, it saved by 2020. Nintendo switch AC adapter. You can put your switch right here. Switch in here, this is so nice. This is fashion. Oh, oops. Sorry. Wow. What is this? Happy fall. Okay, well, I'm gonna put this up for my Thanksgiving celebration alone. 'Cause I'm not gonna travel for the holidays cause Covid. Happy fall. This is so... This is so nice. I'm gonna put it back here. Beautiful, happy fall. And we've got some leaves. This is gonna be nice for Thanksgiving decoration, and some little lights. This is a very, very nice little kit. Next up. We've got this big mystery coin box. What could it be? (box thuds) Oh my gosh. What the heck? There is so much stuff in here. Champion and Nintendo teamed up to launch a limited edition collection in honor of the super Mario brothers, 35th anniversary. (gasps) Look at these pins. These pins are perfect. We even have a Pez dispenser. Another thermos. I have a thermos with my coffee every morning. So now I'm gonna get to really switch it up. We've got Mario and Animal Crossing together. What a great day. Oh, a little coin box. What is this? Is this something I can eat? Coin candies, yes it is. I'll have that. What an incredible box? Can you believe I have a Tom Nook hat on right now? Let's take a look at this, this is nice. This is like a very premium sweatshirt. Do you see what's on my head right now? Tom Nook. Do you see this sweatshirt? This is a very nice material, Oh my gosh. And sweat pants to boot, flower power, this is so nice. I'm wearing this tonight. Do you see your decoration back here? Happy fall. Oh, these fit nice. They're going to be real nice, when I'm not wearing two pairs of pants. This is, this is incredible. This is an amazing fit. I haven't had a piece of champion gear, since I was like in high school. 'Cause Tyler's like a photographer. He could like take some cool, like (camera shatters) I don't ever wanna take it off. I don't have to. Well, look at my leg. Look at my leg, hold on. Can you believe I'm already wearing Nintendo socks? - No, those were all my feet.(chuckles) I'm so happy. Look at this bag, let's play show and tell. Just place your Nintendo switch in there. This was probably one of my most favorite mystery gift boxes. I just can't believe how nice this is like the... I think I'm into champion. I didn't even know it. - I mean, I did too. I didn't know that like... I didn't know now I know. Lego-- - [Mario Toy] Lego Mario time. - Lego Mario's here. (toy squeaks) I don't even know what else to say. What do you guys think? Do you think this is awesome? Because even if you say no, I'm not... I'm gonna call you a liar because this is incredible. Wow. Wow. World one one set. Does that mean? What? Well, thanks for watching. I'm gonna go do a photo shoot now. (upbeat music)",
