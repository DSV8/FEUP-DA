    "transcript": "- Guys, I've got a mystery box here from YouTube. I don't know what's inside of it. I'm not sure how many of these they've sent out. You've probably already seen people unbox these, but I haven't seen anybody unbox, I have no idea what's inside of here, so I just thought that I would do like a little mystery unboxing for you. YouTube always sends out like really cool things to some of their creators, I'm gonna take a picture of this so that I can post it on the Internet. Oh, my Postmates will be here in three minutes. So, I don't think that there's anything I need to cut, or is there? But, we like to always have a knife just in case. If you've already seen somebody unbox this, you guys can probably guess what's inside of here. I don't know, but I'm excited to find out. Congratulations on an incredible year, here's to many more. #YouTubeHolidayGift I am not good at checking my mail, (laughs) apparently. I'm not sure what the holiday is. (gasps) Oh, my goodness, this is actually freaking fantastic. It's a suitcase! We're excited to see what you create in 2019, we'll be here, watching, liking, and subscribing from the sidelines, the YouTube Team. Thank you, guys. Oh, my gosh, and there's a luggage tag. So great. Look at this, oh my gosh. If there's one thing that I go through a lot, it's luggage, I bet I could fit in this box. I'm just gonna ... (box crashes on floor) The stuff all around my house is just like falling from the ceiling now. I have been traveling with something this size, but it's one of the soft cases, and I travel with all of my electronics in a suitcase like this. The other day, when I was going through TSA, I don't know if the TSA could see that I could see him talking to himself, but as my bag went through, he was like, \"This bag has all of the electronics that I own in my house \"in one bag,\" he said it like, that's exactly what he said, and then I was like laughing, like thinking he was making a joke about it, and then he goes, \"That's stupid.\" (laughs) Okay, I think that he just called me stupid. He never even looked up, didn't look away from his computer monitor, he was just talking to the computer, telling my bag that it was stupid, and I thought to myself, I was like, \"But, sir, that's my whole life in that bag, that is actually my entire life is inside of that suitcase, and it's kind of crazy to think about everything that I'm making right here, right now, like my camera, my computer, I had my drone, I had all my hard drives, I had lenses, it was basically everything that I need, it was like a mobile studio in a suitcase, maybe it was stupid, or maybe it's my life, sir. Look at this cute little tag, they've got my little avatar although it did recently change, my avatar picture, so it's new, I wanna keep this on here, this ribbon, this is so smooth, it's very smooth and wide. This is like some serious double-sided tape. Alright, okay, let's open it up and see what's inside. This is one of the Away suitcases, too. (gasps) Oh, it's got the battery in it, you cannot check batteries inside of your luggage, that is something that is fairly new, so if you do have a battery that is inside of your suitcase, they will not let you check it, so if you do have a battery pack inside of one of your suitcases, and you do plan on checking it, take it out and carry it on, so this is the perfect carryon size. Oh, these are so nice, oh my gosh. (gasps) I didn't even see this, my little name is here on the suitcase. Oh, wow, this is so great. There's just something about having your name on something that is so cool, it takes me back to like when I was little, my mom would like put my little name on my lunchbox. Oh, this is nice, oh my god, there's something else in here, there's more things in here, what? What is this? A gift, is it something I can eat? Stickers, oh my gosh, they're postcards! This is so cool, I can put stickers on my suitcase. Now, I get it, to customize my bag, so what else is in here? I think this is probably the charging cable. Directions, so these are just to charge the battery pack, which is great, I like this bag, this is actually a very nice cord bag, it's got a little arrow on it, I'm gonna put stickers on here, so thank you, YouTube, and thank you guys. Well, that's it, I just wanted to unbox this because it said YouTube on it, and it looked so cool, and my name, I can't wait to take this on my next travel adventure. Honestly, the luggage tag is super cool, my little name, I love customized things. (laughs) Thank you, YouTube, and thank you guys for watching. If you guys have any other suggestions for some things that you would like me to make here on my channel, leave those in the comments below, and I'll see you in the next video. Where are we gonna go? Oh, my phone is ringing. Hello? - [Postmates Driver] I'm your Postmates deliverer. - Oh, okay. - I'm just trying to find-- - Are you here? - Ummm ... Yeah, I'm here, I'm outside. - [Justine] Ummm. (fun, upbeat music)",
