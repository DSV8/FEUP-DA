    "transcript": "- Hey, it's Justine and today, we are unboxing the brand new DJI Osmo Pocket 3. This little camera has been one of my favorites over the past couple of years, and I'm so excited they now have a brand new version for us to check out. Ooh, a nice little case. Let's open up this little case first. This is so nice, and it feels like one of those dry bags so it can keep it safe and away from any liquid damage. What? This is so cute and organized. Protective cover, so we have the Pocket itself. Here it is. So we've got our little battery handle here, we've got our microphone, oh my goodness! Look how nice this looks, it's all see-through. So what's cool about this is, this does have a built-in transmitter. So if you do want to use a microphone with it, you can use the little transmitter and this will act as the receiver so you don't need any additional cables, it's already built in, which is awesome. And these handles are really easy to use. You just plug them in with USPC. Magnetic, little mic clip. We'll just, keep you with your friend. Look at this mini tripod! It's so cute. I can't believe all the stuff fits in this bag. Jeez! There's still more. We've got the little wind wig to put on top of our microphone. Wrist strap, very nice. (upbeat music) I can't believe how much stuff came in this tiny little bag and it all fits perfectly. Now that everything's unboxed, I'm gonna set it up, and take it out to start testing. (upbeat music continues) (upbeat music continues) So I'm now outside testing out the new Osmo Pocket 3. And this thing has, by far exceeded my expectations. Like, I've used the past two generations and they were cool, but there is something about this that just feels perfected. I feel like when we get into the third gen of any type of tech, cameras, drones, phones, this is where they really have the ability to refine all of the things that were wrong with previous versions and make them right. So this one has me so excited to create content and especially for vertical and short form content creators, I think this is gonna be such a win for them and me, I also create that as well. So this has a one-inch sensor that lets you shoot up to 4K, 120 frames per second. It's got improved low light with night shots and the ability to shoot in 10-bit D-Log-M and 10-bit HLG color modes for more control when coloring in post. The focus on this feels so much faster and it even has product showcase mode that will focus on a subject quickly and smoothly. The stabilization is also incredible. In this video you can see, I'm running really fast on the beach and it's so steady. You can also choose from different rotational speeds to suit whatever scenario you're in. Much like other DGI products, this has Active Track 6.0, which gives you different types of follow modes like face, auto detect, and dynamic framing. The sound on this is also pretty impressive, which I really like because I can just take this out. I don't need to have anything else. But this does have an integration with the new DGI Mic-2. The receiver is already built-in, so you could just use one of the transmitter mics, and you're good to go. Okay, so here is what it sounds like without using a microphone. I'm in my studio, it's a little bit echoey. So when I turn this on, it's gonna connect automatically, and you can hear what this sounds like. Test, test, testing, one, two, three. Okay, so here it is. I'm now talking on the DGI Mic-2. How does it sound? I also have the tracking on, so it's tracking my face. So no matter where I go, it's gonna keep me in check. If you do have the DGI Mic pack one, that will also work with this, but you will need to plug in the receiver. Those things have been my microphone go-to for filming on the go. And also when I'm filming with my iPhone, I can just plug that receiver in and it works perfectly. This has a built-in three-mic array that reduces wind noise and records omnidirectional stereo to give your viewers an even more immersive experience. It does support USB external microphones and headphones to monitor audio. Now, the highlight of this video, which you may have seen in some of the B-roll shots already, is the fact that you can flip this little screen, flip. Now, with that, it'll automatically switch it into shooting in vertical, which makes filming with this so incredible. I can be filming in wide screen and then within, not even a second, I can flip this and be filming a vertical video as well. I think this is going to be so key for so many creators because this gives you the ability to quickly shoot both. This little storage case is also my favorite. I love it because you have a little section here to store some of the filters. So in here, I have a wide-angle lens and a black Pro-Mist filter and these are also magnetic. So it's so easy to pop them right onto the lens on the go. Oh, and did I mention that it also takes photos? I tend to forget about taking photos when I'm reviewing cameras, mostly just because I'm such a video person that photos is not usually on my mind. But when I first started taking some photos with this, I was absolutely blown away by the quality. It's also pretty cool because this is a gimbal. You can take really cool panorama photos because the gimbal and camera just moves right around and gets the perfect shot. Something else that I love is being able to use this with the DGI Mimo app. I can connect this to my phone and download all my videos and photos and share them instantly on social, or if you're like me and love editing on your iPhone, you can also start editing all of your content right there. DGI also has some really cool AI features, so I really love that they give you all of these options inside of the app and it gives people flexibility who may not be video editors, the chance to really create and make something really cool and share it immediately. So yeah, my friends, that is the DGI Osmo Pocket 3. I am so impressed with it. And if you're a content creator, I swear, you could probably just get away with having this. This is it, you've got this, you've got your little Lav microphone, you would be good to go!",
