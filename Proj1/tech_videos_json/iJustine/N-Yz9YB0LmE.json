    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And today is the day, Vlog University is here. This is an event that I've been working on for the past year but this has been basically 10 years in the making. I thought of this little show idea that I did on YouTube over 10 years ago and now it's here, it's an actual event. People are filling in. The keynote is about to start. And I just wanna give you guys a quick little look at what's happening at Vlog University this weekend. I could not be more excited. This is so, I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out! (upbeat electronic music) Jenna, Vlog University's here. - Yes, it is. - This is where my microphone is so I'm making sure that she can hear me. Jenna, how's it going? - Good, this is how the professionals do it. - This is how the professionals do it. - Good luck today. - Thank you. I don't really have much else to say. - I don't either. (chuckles) - But that night, you take it, you put your leg underneath your pillow. While you're sleeping, the leg fairy comes and the next morning you look under the pillow and you find a handicapped parking pass. (audience laughs) - I decided to come because Justine's been such a big inspiration to me and learning what I love to do from the people who I look up to is honestly such a surreal experience and I feel so grateful I was able to attend. I'm so excited to learn more, especially about editing in Final Cut Pro because - Yes, that'd be great. - it's just my passion. - In life, in creating content, in uploading content, in building an audience, in learning the tools that you'll be learning about today and tomorrow, there is no three strikes and you're out rule. You get as many strikes as you want. You strike out when you quit. - So the day is beginning. We're gonna be posting so much stuff on social media, of course, on Instagram and Twitter, so you can follow me and, also, you can follow Vlog University on Instagram and Twitter as well. I am just so excited and so honored that everyone believed enough in this event to come out and hang out, especially all of our speakers and sponsors, and just all of you guys for even being there. If you're not actually here, you guys are here in my heart. Jenna, come here. Have some words, hello! It's Jenna. - Hi. - So it's crazy 'cause I was thinking, when I started my little keynote part I was talking about how much stuff Jenna has put up with over the years. - Oh, yeah, it's a lot. - It is a lot. But this day is here. - It is here. Well, it's crazy 'cause I actually just realized that I was on YouTube for 10 years. (Justine gasps) So that's a long time. - She made a little 10-year montage. It's gonna be in our session. We're doing that tomorrow. So yeah, it's here. And I don't know what else to say other than I'm excited, and Jenna has a little badge. You're a speaker! - I got my badge. People are like, \"When's your speech?\" I'm like, I don't know. I'm here all, I'll be here all weekend. - Okay, that's the end of this video. - Okay. - Bye. Wait, we gotta show the vlog squad. Here's our vlog squad. I will just AirDrop this to you. We have Connor and Tyler and Armando. Oh my gosh, I'm so excited, and Jenna. - Official. - This is so great. Okay, vlog squad U, Vlog U squad, let's go. (upbeat electronic music)",
