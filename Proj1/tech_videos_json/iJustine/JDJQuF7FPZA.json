    "transcript": "- You guys, there is the latest version of iOS out. This is iOS 12.2. When I think about how far we've come in iOS, it's super shocking. One of the most exciting things obviously, there's a ton of other updates in this update but there's also four new Animogis. So we need to check those out immediately. So in addition to the Animojis, there's obviously the Apple News Plus subscription so that's now available. You can now ask Siri on your phone or your iPad to play any game or sports or channel or movie or video or anything on your Apple TV so that's kinda cool, you can basically use Siri to control your Apple TV. There's an update to Apple Pay so you can now instantly transfer your money from your Apple Pay account to your account. Let's see what else there was. For Air Play, you can have dedicated TV controls in Control Center, Screen Time, ooh, down time can be configured with a different schedule for each day of the week. That's nice because what if I want to have more fun on my phone on the weekends? I don't know, or less fun, there's now support for AirPods too. Apple Music, the Browse tab shows more editorial highlights, okay. Supports air quality index in Maps for the U.S., U.K. and India. I didn't even know that that was a thing. This is all great, but what about the Animoji? I don't even have an Animoji made on this phone I don't think. So, here's the new Animojis. We've got a giraffe, we've got a shark, which is gonna be so great for Shark Week. Look at this little owl, and what are you? Are you a wild boar? I haven't even configured my cell phone Memoji. That's not me, I used to have one and then I don't know where it went. Hairstyle, give me my beautiful, luscious locks. Does that look like me? That does look like me, my spaghetti hair. Spaghetti. Wait a minute, where did my hairstyle go? Eyes, I always thought that I had green eyes and my mom said that she didn't think that I had green eyes. I do have darker eyebrows than my hair because what do you know, my hair's not this color. That looks cool, nose and lips. Okay, what about this one? Oh yeah, look at that. We look alike. I don't have facial hair. Wait, I do have earrings in, let me put some earrings on myself. So, I'll put that. I don't think this looks like me. I think maybe my lips are too big. Like, what do I think I am, Kylie Jenner, no. Absolutely not. I also feel like my eyes don't really, they have big eyes. I also think my head shape is off. No, that looks better. Okay, I'm gonna use that one. Hey Jenna, how's it goin? Do I look cool or what? Oh my god, she's gonna get so annoyed. Now it's time to test out the giraffe. Oh my gosh, it's so funny. Wow. Hi Jenna, do you want to I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what to say. Baby, it's Shark Week. Show Brie your teeth. (laughs) Is it Shark Week yet? (light music) People look so crazy when they're making these. Let me see what it'd look like if I have a big smile. I'm into it. Hoo, hoo, hoo. (laughs) Now I got dizzy from shaking my head around so freaking fast. Are we having fun? Are we going to the mall later? It's always so weird because you can hear people making mouth sounds when they're making their Animojis. The shark is probably my favorite. Hey guys, I'm a shark. I'm having a good day, I hope that you are as well. Let me show you my beautiful teeth. (light orchestral music) These are so good. The giraffe also, he's so cool, look at him. He's so cool. I think I did a good job of making my Memoji look a little bit like myself. Hm, my hair's a little bit longer but it's okay. Well, I just wanted to show you guys some of the new Animoji's cause I think that I really, really, really like the shark. I think he might be my favorite Animjoi that they have made to date. It's so perfect, it's so great, just in time for Shark Week. I'm just getting so excited for all of the fun. New Apple announcements this year. I have been actually using this iPad so much, way more than I ever thought that I would. I'll be doing a follow up video on this very soon. Has my necklace been messed up this whole time or, was somebody gonna tell me or what? When is Shark Week, I don't remember. When is Shark Week. - [Siri] I don't see any movies matching a shark playing nearby for this week. - Okay, well you tried, solid effort. I'm getting so excited for all of the fun tech this year, it's just already so overwhelming just thinking about all of the crazy things that are gonna be coming out. So many fun things to make videos about. Let me know what you guys are most excited about. What's your favorite piece of tech? When I make videos, what are the things that you like watching me test out the most? I look forward to hearing what you guys think and in the meantime, I will see you in the next video, so have a nice day, or night, or evening or whatever the time is for you, bye. (light music)",
