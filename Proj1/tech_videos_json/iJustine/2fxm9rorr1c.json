    "transcript": "(light music) - Let me tell you what today is. It is September 21st, 2018 it is the launch of the new iPhone X, XS Max. And I am here in Union Square at the Apple Store. Four years ago my sister and I were sleeping outside in Santa Monica in a tent waiting for our iPhone 6. - [Jenna] Oh my gosh, you look like you're in a dog house. - We're beginning, the camp out. Okay so here is the line of people. Everybody's lining up, so where's the start? Is it? - Yeah. - The first person in line isn't even here right now. - Do say hi to my vlog. - Hi vlog I'm like the biggest Ijustine fan and I'm freaking out I'm like-- - Awe that's so cool. Hi are you guys first in line? I was about to take your spot, cause they said first in line just stepped away. How are you? (laughing) - Say Hi to my vlog. - Hi, hi um. - So wait, what time did you get here? - Wednesday morning. - What's today? - Today is Friday. - They've been here since Wednesday. - Watching your videos for forever. - That's so cool. Wednesday wow I'm so proud of you guys. (light music) So the whole thing about this store is there's this beautiful front that also opens up, but there is a back. We have 15 minutes until the store opens, so let me take you guys for a quick tour. The crazy thing is this stores been open for, what'd you say like a year and a half ish? - [ Camera Man] Yeah, yeah no two years. - Two years, wow oh my god I feel it just opened not too long ago. I spent a lot of my time in San Francisco when I first moved to California. And I was outside for the first Ipad launch. (cheering) I've made so many videos in Apple Stores in San Francisco. I'm in an Apple Store. I don't think I've made a video in this one yet actually. This is the Market Street San Francisco Apple Store. Its just so fun to be back here at one of my favorite stores. This is the back, they've got this nice little fountain. Its so beautiful, and they have trees inside, trees outside. Oh I love it, okay lets go back to the front of the line. Its the news, its the news. There's something that I just love about being on the news. You think I can get on the news today guys? I love the news. - I've watched pretty much every single one of your videos. And I just love you so much thank you-- - Oh my gosh thank you, it was so nice to meet you. Bye. - I've known you ever since you got the box for your first iPhone. - That was like 2007, that was the first phone. - That was insane I loved it so much. - Six, five, four, three, two, one. (cheering) - They're coming in, they're coming in. (cheering) I guess now its time to go shopping. I've got to get a new case for my phone. So, what do you think? That's a good color. - [Camera Man] I live the lavender. (gasps) Oh, I do too. The lavender does look really good. - [Camera Man] Yeah. - That's a good choice. I'm also gonna need a pink. What is this like for you knowing how much time, effort and work you guys have put in to this? To see how happy you make people. (laughing) - You know I think that's just it, the products make people happy. Its why they line up, its why all the excitement. I mean its , honestly its the day of the year we so look forward to. Design creates it, and it gets all the way here in to our hands. But then I always say the difference is our voice. - [Justine] Yes its true. - Right I mean, they make all the difference in the world. Great products, great employees, like you said that's why people line up. - I've met so many people in the Apple Store that are now like my best friends. I've come in to the genius bar asking questions and now they're some of my closest friends. You guys hire some of the greatest people. - Thank you. - Thank you so much, I'm gonna give you a hug. - Aweh. - Congratulations. - Thank you so much, I really appreciate it. - One XS Max and an Apple Watch stainless steel series 4. - Ah we're twins. - Oh my gosh you're matching did you know that? - Wait, this is. - Oh. - What is happening? - I'm going to take off my jacket. (laughing) - I can't believe we're matching. Look at that camera quality. - Wow that's fantastic. - Smart HDR. - I keep calling it super HDR by accident because its super. - I think that sounds even better to be honest. - Next year, next year it will be super. So my sister helped me for the past four or five days filming so many videos for the new iPhone and the new Apple Watch. So I'm going to get her a present, the new Apple Watch. I'm going to get her the stainless steel in the space black. Lets go do a little shopping. I just bought these cases on my phone. Yes thank you so much. Did you get your phone? - Yes oh my gosh I'm so frigging excited thanks to her video last night I made a decision. - That's amazing I was like this is crazy she's like I just watch your video yesterday. - Thank you. - It was so nice to meet you. - So so nice to meet you. - You too. - Have a great day. - So Apple Watch for Jenna. And now I'm going to head to the airport and fly home. Thank you Apple, thank you guys for watching. If you enjoy this video or any of my other videos make sure you hit subscribe, hit the bell so you're notified when I make new videos and I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye. My baby.
