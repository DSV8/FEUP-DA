    "transcript": "- Hey, guys, it's Justine, and today, we have the new Samsung 8K QLED TV. This is the 82-inch version. We saw this at CES, this year, and it was absolutely amazing, and guess what. It is here, and we are about to unbox it. Side note, it's really heavy. Could we just, this doesn't even span the length of my arms. (bright music) Let's unbox. This is so huge, and this isn't even the biggest version that they have. The biggest version is a 98-inch model. They also have a 65, a 75 and an 85, and this is somewhere sort of in the middle. This is the 82-inch. I hope that the TV stand that I got is big enough. You guys know how I am with measuring. I'm also really excited to try this, because it has something called 8K AI Upscaling. Now I don't shoot my content in 8K just yet, but with the 8K AI Upscaling, it ensures that my content looks amazing, even if it isn't 8K. I'm gonna let this go, and it's gonna just be like a big reveal. (Justine gasps) (Justine sighs) There's a lot of stuff going on. Let me resort back to my manual (chuckles). Wow. Oh, these are the legs. All right, I'm gonna get these legs on this thing, and then we're gonna set it up on the TV stand and get it all set up. (dramatic music) A good day, friend - Goodness. I wish that all of you guys were here, right now, in this room, witnessing what I'm witnessing right now. - Hello, and we're all good. (Justine gasps) - We're in. One of the things that I've noticed already is, normally, sitting on the floor at this angle with any other television, you would not be able to get a clear view of the TV, because viewing angles can be so finicky, but with this, it has an ultra-viewing angle, so basically, anywhere that you are in the room, you're gonna have a really great view of the TV. So here's ambient mode. This is kinda cool, because usually, if your screen is off, it'll just be a black screen, which is kinda boring. But this has all kinds of really cool things. You can add things like the weather or the time or latest news headlines. Listen. (water pattering) I feel like I'm in the tub right now. These look so good, wow! Anytime I'm done editing a video, I love to see what it looks like on a television, and now this is so easy to do, because with AirPlay 2, all I have to do is, I can export my video, and then I'm just gonna share it, using AirPlay 2, and like magic, it's on your TV. AirPlay 2 support isn't just in this TV. It is available as a firmware upgrade to 2018 Samsung Smart TVs, and it's kind of crazy, because this is available in 190 countries, worldwide. It is the first to have the Apple TV app integrated in the TV platform. No external hardware is needed. And the new app brings over 100,000 movies and TV shows, and you can subscribe to premium channels like HBO and Showtime. And you can even AirPlay music. I have an incredible royalty-free track here, prepared just for you. (\"Bombs Away\") You can also share YouTube videos, much like this video from CES, where I'm actually looking at this TV, in Vegas. Here, it's showing you how we're able to use AI and upscale content. So content that is not ready for 8K televisions-- Did you hear what Justine, several months ago, just said? She was talking, well, wait, I'm she. Me, I, I was talking about the AI upscaling, which is something that is really fascinating to me, because I don't yet shoot in 8K. So it will automatically be upscaled to look incredible on this television. And one of the great things about this TV, that I may have mentioned before, is the Ultra Viewing Angle is incredible. So you can be anywhere in the room and still have a perfect view of the screen. No one ever sees me, sees me Losing every battle - We've been talking a lot about 8K content, so let's view some 8K content. Everything is so crystal clear and lifelike that sitting in front of this TV is like looking out an open window, into the world. It really is overwhelming how amazing this picture quality looks, in person. (dramatic music) There's another really cool thing called the ambient mode. So this is the ambient mode button. So when you press that, it brings you into this little selection here, and it'll just display different types of content. So you can also sync this up to play your own photos as well. You can look at \"New York Times\" headlines. Here, you can check the weather, 71 and sunny, in my current location. And it's really cool, because you can also have-- Are you done talking yet, 'cause I'd like to play some games? Actually, speaking of games, this just reminded me of something. So there's this really cool feature, called Real Game Enhancer, and it uses variable refresh technology, motion blur reduction, and what I'm most excited about is this Auto Game Mode. It helps minimize the input lag, so if you have a controller, and you're trying to play a first-person shooter game, like, that little bit of input lag makes me-- Okay, cool, all right. Cool, it's great. I'll just go be over here. It makes me crazy. It can definitely affect your gameplay. And you guys know it's true. Or maybe it's because you're actually not very good, and you need someone else to blame. Uh, hmm, I think I'm done with you now. No, no, no. No, no, no, don't turn me down, no, no! Are you still talking? Don't, no, no, no! Can you hear me? Yeah, I think we're, yeah-- Me! I think we're done with her. Let's play some Rocket League. Oh my god, this is so fast! I can't even find the ball. Wait, what color am I? Do I want to be going in that hole? I scored! I am a champion! Sign me up for whatever I need to sign up for. Am I just that incredible? Somebody save it, somebody save it! Are you my friend? Oh shoot, shoot, shoot, no, come on! Can I drift? God, I'm gonna get so into this game! (Justine groans) Anyway, I could play this all day long, but I just wanted to thank you guys so much for watching. I would love to hear what you guys think of this TV, and I cannot wait to watch more content on this. Again, a huge thank you to Samsung for sponsoring this video. You guys are amazing, and I look forward to, um, continuing to play this game. So I'll see you guys later. Rocket League, let's go.",
