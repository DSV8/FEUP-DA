    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - Hey guys, it's Justine, and today I have an unboxing, or unbagging, if you will, of something that I am so excited about. These are the official iJustine Pink USB cables, and we have them in a variety of sizes, a variety of types. We've also got Thunderbolt USB-C, we've got USB-A, we even have USB Micro, which was a choice that I made to make, even though I wish that it would go away forever, but if we have to still have it, let's make it pink. So, all of these cables I partnered with Kondor Blue on, and they are an incredible camera company that makes so many amazing camera accessories cables, and now Kondor Blue, I guess we could call them Kondor Pink, in the meantime. What's really great about partnering with Kondor Blue is, not only do they have high-quality products, but they do have a lifetime warranty on all of their cables, and that's one thing that has been upsetting about other cable companies is most of them barely have a warranty at all, so, the fact that these are backed by a lifetime warranty is super exciting. So, here's everything that we have in front of us. We've got super cool packaging, and another really exciting thing is, of course, yes, we do have all of the cables, but we've also got an official iJustine carrying pouch. This is actually fully custom designed. This was inspired by this really cheap mesh bag that I had been using for the past couple of years, and I liked it, but there were so many things that I didn't like about it. The only thing that I really liked about it, was the fact that it was mesh, and it was about this size, so, this has a super high-quality, industrial zipper with these metal iJustine pull tags that match the pink metal on the USB cables. The mesh is also a larger, more industrial mesh, and one of the best parts about it is the inside has two little loops, so, if you have an Apple pencil, or even an analog pencil to write on paper, or a marker, or something like that, you can put that right inside there. This also zips all the way open, and I've been traveling with this for the past couple of weeks, and it is so perfect, so, I'm so happy with how this came out. So, let's unbag all of these cables, and I'll show you what we've got. Now, obviously, since I am a huge iPhone fan, we had to make some Lightning cables. Now, originally, my plan was we weren't gonna make these, because I thought that the new iPhone would be USB-C, but, spoiler alert, it's not. It's still Lightning, and I feel like a lot of people have iPhones or other products that are Lightning enabled, so, we've got a USB-A, and the USB-C, so, whichever one you decide that you need. Now, these are, actually, as you can tell, in this nice little box packaging, that's because these are certified to work with Apple products. Now let's open these up. This is the USB-A. I like that these have these little reinforcements where the cable, and the USB meets, because it helps it become way more sturdy. Now, this is a braided cable. It is beautiful, it is pink. Oh, my gosh, I love it so much, and you'll see right here, it's got my little name on it. Can we just take a look at these zippers? Look how beautiful they are. We've also got our little name there. I've got Kondor Blue and iJustine on the seam. It's like my favorite thing ever. Our next cable, we have the C2 Lightning. I think we've all seen this before. Each of these cables are 3.3 feet, which I felt was long enough, but not too short, but also not too short, so, it's kind of just right there, perfectly in the middle. The next one, we have a six foot USB-C, and this one has a right angle USB-C on it. This actually comes in a one foot, three feet, and six feet version. This can deliver up to 100 watts of power, and it has fast data transfer speeds, up to 10GB a second. Here's the one foot version and the three feet. I do realize that some people don't always use USB-C to USB-C, so, we also have got the USB-A to USB-C, and this one is three feet long. There it is. This will give you up to 60 watts of power, and you can get fast transfer speeds at 5GB a second. So, depending upon what speeds you're looking for, you can choose a cable that is right for you. Speaking of speed, there is a need for it, and we also have a Thunderbolt 4 cable. This could quite possibly be my favorite. Most of the drives that I have are Thunderbolt compatible, so, this one is definitely at the top of my list. This comes in a three foot length, and for a Thunderbolt cable, I feel like that's pretty standard. This is able to power an 8K display or dual 4K displays. This has some very fast data transfer speeds, up to 400GB a second. Of course, we've got our iJustine logo on the other side. Now the last but not least is the micro-USB cables. This is a 10 inch cable, and this is great for a lot of tiny accessories, drones, batteries, cameras, headphones, you name it. Mostly I use this to charge my wireless Lavalier microphones, so, this is definitely something that I really wanted was a small micro-USB cable, because all of the ones that I have are so long that it's like, I don't need that. I just need something tiny and small to be able to charge. Now this one is 30 inches, which it is a little bit larger, so, this is, I feel like a standard size, which I also like, because sometimes you do need to plug things into the wall, so, you do need a little bit longer of a cable, so, both of these together, it's like a dream come true. Let's make it smile. It's smiling. This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I actually haven't seen them all inside of this case. This is the first time. Look at this. It looks so great. Ah, I love it! So, here they are. I'm gonna put a link in the description, if you wanna purchase these, and Kondor Blue, actually, has a huge giveaway happening on their website, so, I'll put a link in the description, if you wanna check that out, and enter. They're not only doing a giveaway of all of the iJustine cables, they're also giving away a ton of Kondor Blue accessories and goodies, and even a camera, so, go check it out, link in the description on how to enter, and also how to purchase these. I look forward to you guys getting these in your hand, and actually seeing how amazing they are. I'm such a huge fan of all of their cables, so, I cannot believe that these are officially iJustine cables, and they're pink, and they're beautiful. I love it so much. Oops, I found a couple more cables that didn't make the cut. Get in! (bag rustling) I cannot wait to see them out in the wild on your gear, in your hands, charging all of your devices. Even if you aren't a fan of the color pink, the color pink is such a great accent to anything, and I feel like a lot of times in the tech industry, everything is very dark colored, or you have a bunch of basic white cables, and these will definitely spice up your set, your desk, your charging situation, and I also feel like it's a pretty good conversation starter. Also, it doesn't make a bad gift. Again, the link is in the description, and I can't wait for your devices to... I was gonna say get their hands on them, but most devices don't have hands. You know what I mean? (upbeat music)",
