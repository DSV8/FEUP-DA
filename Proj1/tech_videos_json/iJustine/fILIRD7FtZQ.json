    "transcript": "- Hey Guys, Its Justine and today we are checking out the brand new GoPro Hero 7 Black. You guys know I sort of have this love-hate relationship with GoPro. The GoPro Karma obviously was by far the worst thing I have ever experienced in my entire life. (loud buzzing) No, no, no oh my god (beep). Don't touch it, it might come alive. But this GoPro, even the previous version, the Hero 6. You guys know I'm such a huge fan of small, portable cameras. All of the reviews that I've seen and everyone that has been talking about this camera has said that they've absolutely been in love with it. And this is the camera that GoPro has needed to make for some time. One of the huge highlights and something that I did notice in some test footage that I've seen is the audio is much better, that is one thing that I've just been harping on GoPro. Please, give us better audio, granted these are action cameras, so a lot of times stuff that this is made for there's usually not audio involved. But, why not make a camera that can do both? Great audio, great picture quality, small, compact. It shoots 12 Megapixel photos, 4K 60, you can shoot 240 frames a second at 1080p. One of things that I like about the most recent GoPros is you don't have to put an external housing on it, this is waterproof up to 10 meters, voice activated, touch controls, 8x slow-mo, GPS, HDR, I just stabbed myself with my knife. I can't wait to test this out, Gimbal-Like Hypersmooth. I think its time to open this. Look at that tab, yes. I got out all of my recent GoPro things right here, so these are the past two versions of GoPros, the Hero 6, and the Hero 5. The Hero 6 had incredible image stabilization, not necessarily when you were kinda moving around from side to side, but going forward, and straight, and just walking it was great. So, here it is, lets take out all the stuff here. Some paperwork, stickers, comes with of course these extra sticky mounts, got your USB-C, the battery, which I'm hoping is the same battery as the previous version. So the battery looks a little bit different, like it has more of like a textured finish to it, so this is the new batter, this is the old battery, it looks the same. I love these dual battery chargers. What's kinda cool is this is actually called the Hero Black, and the color is black, whereas these previous versions were kinda like a more tinted little gray color. So in comparison to, this the Sony RX0 and I love this camera. The audio is great, it has a large sensor so it brings in a lot of light. When I used to vlog a lot more, I used to use this all the time. So this is still such an incredible high quality camera. You can do audio-in, you can also do external 4K recording. That was probably one of the only things that I had kind of a gripe about is it didn't record 4K, but you can do 4K external recording if you chose to do so. So here's the Sony compared to this little GoPro, about the same size. Well that's the unboxing now it's time to test this out, the rest of this video is going to be completely shot on this GoPro. Let's do this. (upbeat music) - [Woman] Nice swing! - So that's the GoPro, that's not safe. - [Woman] What if you hit your GoPro? Oh my god! - What? - [Woman] Justine, that was centimeters away from hitting that. - Really? - [Woman] Yes! Oh, Justine! - - What? - - Wait, you're not allowed to do that. - [Woman] It was so close. (upbeat music) - So far I've been so impressed with the stabilization on the 7, as you can see on our bike ride the stabilization on the 6 and 7 it is almost, I mean you can compare it but there really isn't a comparison, the 7 wins by a long shot. Now let's check out the 120 frames a second while we ride on the bike. (calm music) 30 frames a second, 4K 30, 4K 30, let's roll. (upbeat music) There's also a new portrait mode so when you rotate the GoPro you can shoot vertical videos and photos. As you can see this is now recording in vertical, the little record is at the top. New shoes, who dis? This looks so cool, I'm glad they added this feature, this is going to be great for Instagram. Okay, vertical video, here it is, what do you guys think? Probably looks exactly the same when it was horizontal, it's just now vertical, it's magic. Also at the beginning of this video you guys may have noticed I did this little time lapse thing, it's called a time warp and I thought that I was recording normal video until I went and looked at it, and I didn't, it was a time lapse, it still looks really cool but it wasn't what I intended of filming. Since I'm in New York I'm going to try out that time warp one more time walking back to my hotel. (upbeat music)",
