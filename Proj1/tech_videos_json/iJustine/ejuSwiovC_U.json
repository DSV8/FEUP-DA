    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today is going to be kind of a two-part video. I have been traveling for the past month visiting my family. So I haven't been back or filmed a video in so long that I'm confused on how to do anything like speaking or unboxing. But I think I got this, I think I can remember, and what an exciting way to remember how to make a YouTube video by unboxing some exciting things from Apple. Now this is their new Pride watch band, and this is the Braided Solo Loop. It is so beautiful. I'm such a huge fan of all of their Pride bands. And I just went through my Apple Watch collection and I found these two from previous years. I think this is probably one of my favorites. I wore this thing forever, like this is so cool. But ever since the Solo Braided Loops came out, these are my favorite. I also have one of the silicone ones, which is beautiful. This is, I forget what color this is, but I really like it. This is my newest purchase. I also got one in this mint color to match this iPhone case that I got. And I said, this was a two-part video, cause I'm also going to unbox my AirTags and this little Belkin AirTag accessory that they... It was pink, so I was like, well hello you need to be in my cart immediately, and now it's here. So these are the custom AirTags. I forget what engraving I got. I think I got a pig and a poo and a skull, and I don't remember the other one. Let's open up the Apple Watch band first, so that I can put this on my body. (Justine gasps) Oh yeah. Look at this. This is so pretty. I love it. I absolutely love it. And I also like that they have the matching watch faces to go with it. Look at that. It looks so good. I have very small wrists. This is a size two. Oh yeah. That's beautiful. I love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it. Now that we have our Apple Watch all unboxed, now it's time to dive into the Apple AirTags. So I've been using the AirTags for a few weeks now and I have some thoughts. Let's unbox, and then we can chat about them. Wait, I need to get my Apple Watch a face. And there's the new watch face, to match the band. Beautiful. Here they are. The custom AirTags. (Justine gasps) Oh a poo. A poo. An alien. A pig and a skull. Those are cute. (upbeat music) Oh yeah. These are super cute. So all the accessories are kind of interesting and they're all a little bit bulky. So I was kind of interested to check out this Belkin one. So it has this secure little loop on it and it's pink. So obviously I had to check it out. So this is kind of a little plastic little number. I'm going to put the pig in here because it's pink. And I like that this has like a little loop on it. The Apple ones kind of have a little snap on it, so my concern while traveling was that it could easily be like ripped off or unsnapped. It is pretty sturdy. Not easily be removed, but it's not like a big challenge. So there we go. That's nice, I actually really like this. There's been so many cool third party accessories that have come out. So I'm definitely looking forward to checking out a bunch of those whenever I get a chance. But my thoughts on the AirTags after using them for a month, is I really like them. I have used them in several situations where I needed to find my keys, and since I was traveling, I had left my backpack at my sister's house and I was able to easily just go and be like, \"Oh, I think I might have left it at her house, but I'm not sure\", Checked my phone, sure enough it was there. And then when I traveled back to Los Angeles I had no idea where I put my keys. Like I actually authentically lost my keys and I had put them in my suitcase. I'm not even sure how it ended up there because I would never normally check my keys. I always make sure that I have them on me, but they ended up in my checked bag, and thankfully I was able to track them and find them easily using the sound. One of the cool security features to avoid being tracked is, you'll get a notification if you were in the vicinity of a tag that has been inactive for a certain amount of time. And it's really cool that they do do this because I feel like that's a huge privacy concern. If someone is able to slip one of these into your backpack or into your purse, and you don't know it. Well now obviously I have not tested out every single tracker out there. So there are other options, and I do think that something like this is very important to have on your items, just in case you do lose them, or if they're stolen. But the stolen aspect is where I feel like there's a slight downfall to these because these will alert you if there's one in your bags. So if your thief in the night, has your package or your bag, they're going to get a notification that there's an AirtTag traveling with them. So they'll be able to easily get rid of it, but on the flip side of things, if someone is using this with malicious intent, you will be notified and you'll be able to easily find that AirTag. So it is kind of difficult to figure out, is this a good thing, or is it a bad thing? And while I was home, it was crazy cause my mom was like, \"Someone's trying to track me\", because she got a notification because I entered the vicinity and I was there for a while, and my AirTags were present and they were around her phone. So it was giving her notification just in case I had slipped one of these into her bag and she was unaware of it. So it's really cool that they do do that. She was able to hit... She was able to just kind of swipe the notification away and say that it's fine. It's me. All as well. But it is cool, because it happened very quickly too. So if she was trying to be tracked by an AirTag, she would have been quickly notified. The only problem is I think I overcompensated for how many of these I would actually need, because I'm like, \"Well, really like four is perfect. My backpack, my purse, my camera and my keys\". Like those are, that's pretty much it. I did put one in my suitcase and then I also put one in another suitcase. So I do feel like there are places that I can put them. So I definitely am getting use out of them, but for the most part, I feel like the four-pack is perfect. I love this little pig. It's so cute. Well, I just wanted to do a quick video and give you guys an update on my custom AirTags. I'm so excited, they did ship a long time ago but since I was out of town, I wasn't here to get them. So I'm very excited to check them out, and I hope that I did an okay job at my first YouTube video back sitting at the desk. Thank you guys so much for watching and thank you again for supporting my channel, and I know I've been a little bit MIA, but I have been traveling and visiting my family. So I will hopefully see you guys soon. I'm definitely looking forward to WWDC. So I will see you guys very soon for that. I can't wait to see what they have to announce. Super hyped. (upbeat music)",
