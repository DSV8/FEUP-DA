    "transcript": "- Hey guys. How's it going? It's Justine. Welcome back to my kitchen and today we are celebrating Valentine's Day the only way that I know how. With my heart. So what we're gonna be doing today is we're gonna be baking a bleeding heart cake. Now I made one of these I think last year for Valentine's Day but this is different because it's going to be an actual real life replica of a real human heart. Because why not? So I pre-made the cakes so you guys didn't have to watch me make another boxed cake. So without further adieu cakes please. oh. Wow. Can you believe they just appeared like this out of thin air. So what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be cutting the tops off of these two and we're gonna be laying these together. So we're gonna have three tiered cake with a bleeding heart on top. So with this excess cake from the tops of it I'm going to mold together to make our heart. So it's basically gonna be like a cake pop heart in theory. This is what I'm thinking. Usually the things I'm thinking never really sort of comes to fruition properly. (popping) Oh wow. Look at this. So I think I'm gonna mix a little bit of this up with a little bit of the butter so it will smooth out a little bit easier 'cause this is this consistency is (plastic pop) thick like my body. This is a lot. Like this is disgusting if you actually think about what this is. Like this is just a ton of icing. (Mixer) This is getting so fluffy. (metal hitting floor) I'm such an idiot. Ugh. Made a mess already. Hardly even started this video. I haven't even touched the cake yet. This is a nice little trick that I saw somebody do once on YouTube. They put icing on this board so that it sticks. So I'm gonna cut the tops off of these. Can't find my cake leveler so it's very upsetting. I don't (dog barking) So we're gonna save this. Put that into there because were gonna be Oh shoot. That's not level. I've gotta find my cake leveler 'cause this is not the life that I live. Probably took off Oh No. You stay there. You monster. We can glue that back together. It'll be like it didn't even happen. You can't even tell. (upbeat techno music) So this is basically the same thing that I did for the home pod but this time instead of a home pod it's gonna have a bleeding heart on top. (upbeat music) Okay, so, we're almost done. This isn't even anything that has to do with the actual cake. This is just like to put the heart on. It's definitely not my best work. Definitely not my worst work. We are gonna be mixing up this lovely little cake mixture and trying to form it into a heart. I hate everything that's gonna happen right now. Ugh. I hate it. This is gonna be not fun at all. I know I gotta go in with the hands but I don't want to. Ugh, this is so disgusting and this icing is like an oil bath. It just doesn't Oh no. I think I might have put too much icing in. Do I have Apple Care on this watch? Could you hand me that other cake over there? Thanks. Yeah. Here, just ugh yeah, that's good. - Okay. You got it. - Yeah thanks. You know what I could've done? I probably could've put this in the mixer. So I think we have a nice consistency that I might be able to form the heart. So I know you're busy filming and everything (laughs) but can you get a picture of a heart? - Does that work? This one? - Hrm. That has a lot of valves huh. - 3D rendering. - Yeah, yeah that's perfect. Okay, so it gonna be kinda like a like a looks like sort of like an egg. How's that look? - I don't want to see here - Ew. Oh geeze. Ew You can just maybe like you can have it over there maybe just like leave it you can flash it like a flash card. Does that look like a heart? So there's a lot of tubes involved in this heart so I think I might I might not get as photo realistic as I'd hoped. Yeah, I don't know if this is really like what a heart looks like. Is this a potato? Did I make a potato? There could be worse ways to spend your day. Like you could be me right now. You could be making this. Don't worry. This will get better. I promise. Ugh, no. You know what? No promises. What have I done. This looks stupid. This doesn't look like a heart at all. So things aren't going quite how I expected. So we need to make kinda like the arteries coming out of the heart. So I'm gonna make some fondant arteries. (crinkling) And then I'm hopefully gonna paint this thing red. (crinkling) I'm not sure. I've definitely messed up my color scheme. Definitely (plop) Oh come on, man. That was a fresh slab of fondant. Oh at this point it doesn't even matter. (upbeat techno music) Oh this looks like a little calamari. Cool. Oh my God I am a genius. I'm like the next Ugh, who's an artist? Picasso. So this is not biologically accurate by any means but don't judge me. It should be a little bit more this way but I'm gonna jam it here because I think it's gonna fall off if I put it anywhere else. (upbeat techno music) So this is what we're gonna be using for the blood. These are some country cherries (dog barking) in a can. That's my dog. Oh wow. So I'm gonna jam one of these inside this little ventricle here. Just for a nice added look. So I need to get these nice and real juiced up. Like real blood. (Blender) I've seen Dexter. Have you? No! No. No. You do not. You do not get to go out like that. That is not fair. I'm just gonna dump it on because what else what's the worse that could happen? Even I'm not sure. This is a look (upbeat techno music) I'm pretty grossed out right now. No No no no no. No no no Oh God (upbeat music) (upbeat music) Not really sure what else I can do to this at this point. It's not quite what I had in visioned. Perhaps maybe better luck next time. Well guys, this is it. I don't think there's anything more that I can even do to salvage this because at this point it's looking like a very very hot mess. Thank you guys so much for watching. I hope you guys have a lovely Valentine's Day. If you have any more suggestions for things you would like to see me bake in the future and that's attempt to bake, of coarse leave those in the comments below and I look forward to chatting with you guys there. So in the meantime I'm, well, I guess I'm just gonna I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Probably go eat this and watch Netflix. See ya later. (Upbeat music) Oh no. Oh no we didn't take any pictures of it. (Techno music)",
