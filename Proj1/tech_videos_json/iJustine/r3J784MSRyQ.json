    "transcript": "- So today I'm going to be showing you guys something. This is an iPhone case, inside of this box. It's not really a case case, but it's like, sort of a case. Edge case, it's got like, a bumper. Like kinda when you go bowling and there's bumpers in the lane so you can like actually, you get the point. So this company's called Gray, and they sent me this. I get a lot of requests to send iPhone cases and people want me to show them on my YouTube channel and usually there's not much that you can innovate with an iPhone case. This is an iPhone case that is (gasps) very expensive. Very very expensive. It costs more than my phone. Basically it costs more than my life, I feel like. I don't even feel worthy that I should be touching it. But I'm gonna open it. Let us unbox. Look at this! I feel like I'm not even gonna do this justice Cause they sent me this note that is explaining what this is, It's a titanium body shrouded in a PVD coat in order to create the rose gold edition. One of only one hundred available world- One of only one hundred? (gasps) Whoa Wow! They've engraved a unique serial number as a reminder of my exclusivity Wow So, wow! Okay, this is pretty cool. So let's put it on. Like on the website, they were talking about how this is like aerospace grade material. This is so fancy. How does this even go on? But will it protect my iPhone from a drop? What's in here? Oh, look at this, they've got other little bumpers to put on too. So I guess I just try to put this on my phone and see what happens. So I feel like this is something that I would probably put on my phone if I'm going out to like a red carpet, really super fancy event. I like to dress my phone up. I usually worry about my phone case more than the outfit that I'm wearing and that sometimes backfires by the time I get to a red carpet everyone is looking super fancy and I'm like yeah but, look at my iPhone case isn't it fabulous? Priorities. Mine are skewed. I guess this just goes on like that? And then this goes on over top of it? How is this secure? Is it secure? Oh baby, wow you look good! Oh yeah! So the little bumpers have other colors but I feel like the black is where I want to be here. I love rose gold jewelry. Like it is probably my favorite as you can tell by the decor on my body. But this looks really good and even like the background of my phone it looks pretty awesome, I will say that. Oh this looks so good, it's so good to see my phone again. It's usually just covered in a case. I mean it has a nice little case that I can put it in when I'm not using it. What do you guys think? Is this crazy? Does it look good? I mean, is it basically jewelry for my phone? This is, it looks like I have 25 of a hundred of them made. Like you can't even say that this doesn't look cool. Cause it does. I mean it definitely looks good. It's very light, so it's not like it's weighing down my phone. Will it protect it? Cause I feel like if I drop this, well no, those, they're pretty snug. I guess that's it, I don't really know how much else I can say about it. If you guys want to check out the link in the description, I put a link to their website. A huge thank you to you guys for sending me this, because I was curious. I went to the site, I'm like (gasp), rose gold! Oh, my heart! It's beating very fast. Measuring, measuring. Seventy beats per minute to be precise. As a gesture of our gratitude, to the viewers of your channel, we'd like to giveaway Oh! Oh, I didn't read the rest of the letter. They are gonna giveaway an iPhone 10 to one of you guys. All you have to do is go to their Instagram account now before November 28, to enter the viewer has to follow their Instagram, comment on their giveaway post, and subscribe to my channel. I think that's pretty easy. This is not a sponsored video, by the way, just in case any of you guys are like sell-out! Spons- it's not. At any chance, if I can facilitate a chance for one of you guys to win an iPhone 10, I'm gonna take it, and I'm going to give that offer back to you guys. So, good luck, let me know what you guys think of this case. I think it's pretty crazy, to be honest with you. I mean, that's a lot of money. But again, think of this as a jewelry for your phone. Thank you guys for watching and good luck. I hope one of you guys win the contest and when you do win, come back to this video and let us all know. I'll see you guys later. Bye!",
