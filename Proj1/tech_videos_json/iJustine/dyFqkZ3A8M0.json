    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today we're doing a follow-up video to my S10+ unboxing review, and my day with the S10+. And we've got a new little friend here, this is the S10e. I'm sure you guys have seen a bunch of videos, and I've also watched a bunch of videos covering both of these phones, and there's been so many great reviews of the S10e, that I needed to check it out for myself. A huge thank you to Metro by T-Mobile for partnering with me on this video. I've been on their network since my trip to New York last year. And since then, their network has been there for me, on the road, through all my travels, and again, through these upcoming few weeks, while I'll be traveling some more. This is also really exciting and such a perfect fit for this video because Metro now has some of the Samsung Galaxy S10 phones in their line-up. It's really great that Metro has these flagship devices because these tend to be a little expensive. But you'll be saving so much with your Metro plan, that it ends up paying for itself. You can get an unlimited high speed data plan for four lines for $30 per line. So now, it's time to unbox, set up, and take these guys outside. This is the prism white. Whoa, it's so beautiful. I thought that I was really into the ceramic, but look at this. I'm not sure if you can tell, but it's so pretty. And just like in the previous unboxing, we've got all of the same goodies, charging brick, dongle, USB. (phone beeps) Whoa, hello. And now, for the S10e, I'm so excited about this little phone. It's crazy how powerful this thing still is. Oh, you're so, I'm so excited. It actually matches my outfit, it matches perfectly. Look at that, I accessorize my phones to my outfits. (giggles) The S10e comes in two different configurations. There's the six gigs of RAM, with 128 gigs of storage, and the eight gigs of RAM with 256 gigs of storage. The battery life on the S10e is 3,100 milliamps, whereas the S10+ is 4,100 milliamps. Both of these phones can take an SD card, so you can expand the storage up to 512 gigs, which I feel like is a lot of storage, especially because I feel like most people store things on the clouds now, the clouds, multiple clouds (laughs) And of the front you'll notice that the S10E only has one camera, and the S10+ has two. So, the two cameras on the front of the S10+, one is actually just for depth, so you'll be able to get better portrait mode photos, and the S10E only has one. Obviously the S10+ has a much bigger screen. This is a 6.4 inch AMOLED display, and the S10e is only a 5.8 inch. - [Phone Voice] Let's look at the terms and conditions. - Google, we're looking, we're looking, okay - you can restore settings and contents from. - Okay. The fingerprint sensor in the S10e is actually located on the power button, which I almost like this placement better than the in-screen fingerprint reader, because I feel like when I'm picking up my phone, I'm just gonna go like this anyway. But as some of you are probably wondering about my S10+ fingerprint dilemma that I was having, and then I did the update the Samsung had, and it worked so much better. I also ended up adding several of my fingerprints. So, since then, things have been working out quite well. I'm not gonna lie, I think I actually like this placement better. Now that both of my phones are set up, I'm gonna take these guys out and take them for a little test. I really like this prism white. It's so pretty, it's super holographic. One of the other cool things is you can wirelessly share power, which is so freaking cool. I showed you guys this in my previous review, but, I just needed to share with you again. Do you need to charge your phone? Well, you can charge your phone with my phone. (phone bleeps) Ooh. You can also charge anything that's T-wireless compatible. So, you could even charge your AirPods, which is insane, if they're the new AirPods, that is. (phone beeping) We've got both of our phones set up. We've got the S10e, the S10+. I just can't get over this prism. It's a beautiful holographic look. Now I have to set up our little rig here. So, the way that I usually do this, is I just get this little tripod, and then I put this little mounting bracket on, and these are little noble clamps, that you just put your phone in, super easy. This is what I use for all of my videos, whenever I'm doing cell phone tests. What's great is, if I put them this way, then, both of the lenses are sort of in a very similar location. One of my favorite features on these phones, is the ultra-wide angle lens. Look at this, it's incredible. One thing I will say though, is you can definitely tell that the image stabilization is not a thing in the video, because it is a little bit shaky, but I'm gonna do a quick little test here. So there's Tyler. - Hi. - Yeah, this looks great, cool. So we're gonna zoom in, one. Okay, there we go, so there's regular. The one thing the S10+ has that the S10e doesn't have, is the telephoto lens. So, I'm super zoomed, am I super zoomed? I can't see myself. - Super. - Super zoomed. - Way zoomed. (Justine chuckles) - It's a little too zoomed for comfort. And now here's what it looks like with the wide angle lens. This is so great. I'm having a lovely time if you guys can't tell. I love doing phone review videos. I think they're probably one of my favorite things to do. Favorite things to shoot, and then when I start editing and realize all this footage that I have, that's when I start questioning my decision. (laughing) Why would I decide to do this? Look how long my arm is. You can't tell how long my arm is, but, it's so long, I feel like I'm Stretch Armstrong. I made that joke already in my previous video, so I'm gonna reuse it. (laughs) Wee. We're gonna test out the front-facing cameras here. Testing both of these out. The lighting in here just looks incredible on these phones. Move it around a little bit. So, yeah, see how the stabilization is. I can't wait to take this outside and film Matty, that's my dog. Do you guys know I have a dog? Have you seen a picture of him yet? I post a lot, I've got to have my dog. (laughs) So, both of these phones do have a wide angle front-facing camera, but what the S10+ has that the S10e doesn't have, is the second camera which is used for depth sensing. So, technically it's a camera, but it doesn't actually take a picture. You guys know that I take a lot of photos and videos, so one of the things that I'm thankful for, with Metro, is their unlimited data, their fast upload speeds, and their wide range of nationwide coverage. I'm always traveling, so just knowing that I'm able to post, and give you guys all the updates, of what coffee I'm drinking, is super important to me, and I know it's super important to you. Right now I'm actually not drinking coffee, I'm drinking Yerba Mate, but you would know that, if you were following on Instagram. Ooh, just taking some selfies here with the live focus. They actually look pretty good. It's great when your outside. (dog barks) because, but whoa, geez. (dog barking) sit (dog barks) actually, oh God, ah (dog barking) Matty come here, it was just Postmates. It's just Postmates, I know, I get excited as well. Who's a good boy? (shutter clicks) Who's the best boy? Oh my gosh, the wide angle looks so crazy. Can you believe those are our legs. When we order our food, we make sure that we get the dog something too. - [Female] He's smiling. - Of course he's smiling. - You're smiling. - I'm not camera ready. - [Justine] She's not camera ready. - [Tyler] It's okay, you're out of focus. - [Female] Sit. - Wow, I have a good. - [Female] Sit. (teeth chomping) Paw, yeah, good boy, paw. Good boy. - Look at that foot. - Big foot. - Keep playing. - [Justine] See if we can get a live focus pup. (shutter clicks) - I gotta give him a treat. - Okay, yes. - There's a good boy. - Look at all of our feet in this wide angle. (coughs) Sit, up, up, up, up, up. Sit, lay down, up, up, up, up, up. Sit, there you go, here's your Postmates. Wide angle looks so good. I got so many cute pictures of Matty. Another great thing is Google One is included in select unlimited plans on Metro, so, all of your photos and videos are automatically backed up, which honestly is so important because, look at this, look at this little baby boy. This needs to be protected and saved. Hi Jenna. - Hello. - Thanks for joining me - Of course. - for this lovely lunch. - She said there was gonna be shopping and food. - I did, but-- - As if. - We're gonna tap on our phones first. - Gonna take your picture, I'll do live focus. Oh, you're cute. Oh my gosh, the wide angle is so crazy. Now take some pictures of me. - How about this? - Yeah, 'cause that's the S10+, that the prism white, it looks so good, look at it. - That's a cool color. - I love it. - Ooh, spicy, I see Tyler in the background. (laughs) I'm gonna do in live focus. Now, did you know that live focus is actually my favorite feature? - It is pretty cool. - I know, that's why it's my favorite feature. Ooh, look, well you know. - This is like my second review. - Oh. - Well, look, we're doing a comparison also with the S10+ with the S10e, - Well, okay. - Look how pretty this blue is. - These are really cool colors. I would get this one, I think. - Yeah, I really like the prism a lot. - I like the blue though. - So, I've also been shopping for things for my new office. Jenna has been there through the beginnings, the middles, and then the starting overs of my office. It's been so crazy, basically just ripped everything apart and completely started over. So, I've been doing some shopping, of course, on Amazon. With your Metro plan you actually get an Amazon Prime subscription, so you can watch movies, and shop, and Amazon Prime, is honestly, how I survive. - I'm saying. - Do you wanna see this table that I'm looking at? I don't know if you'll like it or not, but I'm into it. - I thought you menat that you were looking at this table, showing them this table. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, on Amazon, I'm talking to you. That one. - Oh, I like that one. - That one, that one's a little expensive. It doesn't even actually look that nice. So, what do you think so far? - I love it, look how crisp this selfie looks. That's a really cool picture. - It actually looks really good, you actually look really pretty. And not, and not that you don't anyway, but it's a really good picture. - So, this is mine, right? Especially after that insult, this is my phone now. - No, but if you do switch to Metro, you can save a ton of money, so I guess essentially you could buy it. So a great thing on the S10e, is, this is actually where the fingerprint reader is. - No way. - Yes, I love it so much. I was really into having the in-screen fingerprint reader, but after using this one, for a day, I am so into it. - Well, 'cause that's usually where your hand goes. - I know. - Aha, I see what you're doing there. - Hey do you want me to charge your phone? Watch this, have you seen this yet? Have you seen PowerShare? Let me blow your small simple mind. - I have, but I'll-- - Yes, but just entertain me. - But I have not. (phones beep) - You know what, I don't think I'd wanna use this feature with you, 'cause you'd always be stealing my juice. - I would. - But, it is good to have, I like that. You know who would actually always use this, Brianne. - That's her other sister. - Constantly, my phone is dead. - My phone's dead. Well, plug it in, bring a multi ear. - That's really cool though. - It is cool. - For emergencies, I'm into that. - All right, well, let's finish our drinks, and our snacks, and, I don't know what we're gonna do next. - Take my picture, I wanna be beautiful. - Okay, one more picture, one more picture. Thank you guys so much for watching, and a huge thank you again to Metro by T-Mobile for partnering with me on this video. It really is amazing to see how much you can actually save by being on the network. I will see you guys in my next video. Let me know if there's anything else you guys would like to see here on my channel, and until then, I'll see you later. (high energy digital music)",
