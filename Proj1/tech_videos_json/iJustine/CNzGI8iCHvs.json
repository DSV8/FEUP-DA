    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and today we've got a new Insta360 GO 2. This is a follow-up to the first version. And what I love so much about this camera is it's kind of like a first-person view camera. Like you can wear it on your shirt. You can place it places that you normally could not put any other types of cameras. I had so much fun with the first version. It actually captured a fall. Well, the camera had to fall, I didn't fall, but I dropped it so far when I was hiking up the side of this mountain. And it captured it. Not really sure where I'm gonna be taking this, but I do plan on going on a very nice COVID-safe adventure. Do I call it COVID-safe? Is there like a proper term for like? Now while I might not be going to Hawaii, I am doing a really fun road trip with my friends and I'm super excited. Wait, I can't say friends, because I can't have friends because that's not COVID-safe. We're all in the same quarantine bubble, this is a dilemma. So let's unbox this, get it all set up, and then I'm heading out on a road trip which I'm very excited about being able to test this out out on the road, because being able to get those really cool FPV shots is a really fun added perspective. (upbeat music) So this has the flow state stabilization, you can mount it anywhere because it is magnetic, which is awesome. 1440P, 50 frames a second. So you can do hyperlapses. You can do wifi previews connected to your phone. Oh, look at you. Oh, you're so cute. It's so small. Look at this, like I could swallow this. Don't swallow it, but I could. I mean, that's small. Like it's smaller than the chapstick, like half the size of a Sony battery. Look at it in comparison to this knife, which it can stick onto because it's magnetic. Oh, okay. This is neat. This is a little magnetic necklace that you can wear. So this allows you to kind of just go like that. Do I look cool? Here's the rest of the accessories. So this is the little case that you can store it in. This also doubles as a charger. Whoa. Wow. This is so neat. This is way cooler than the last version. Can I remote record? Oh, you can. So you can use this as a remote and it connects. So I can start recording with the case. When I unboxed this first version of this, the thing that I said was how excited I was for the next version. I mean, it was actually opening the first version I was like the next one is going to be incredible. The first one was awesome but this has basically taken everything that we learned from that first one and turned it into, look at this. It's got like a little tripod. Can you just. I'm so into this. There's a mount right here. So if you wanted to use a larger tripod you could. Also powered by USB-C. Is this a little cradle? Is this a little bed for you to take a little nap in? It has a little hammock. It's a clip. Look at that. What's this? A pivot stand. I'm learning as I open it. Look at that. You're cute. So here's everything that comes in the box. You have your magnetic necklace, you've got the camera. You've got this little pivot stand. You've got your little hammock that is actually a clip. Your USB cable and the super cool case that charges. It also doubles as a tripod. I love the fact that they've decided to integrate a remote into this which will let you easily control this with a little display on it. So that's pretty neat. Let's connect it to my phone, do a firmware upgrade and get outside. Or inside, I don't know what's gonna happen next. (upbeat music) Hi, we're doing some lightsaber training today. Totally normal morning. - [Instructor] Totally normal. - Totally normal. (adventure music) I'm scared! (Justine laughing) (lightsaber whirring) My lightsaber stopped working. I think I've dropped it one too many times. I think it's dead. (upbeat music) Hey Jen, you ready for this run? Are you ready? - [Jenna] Maybe. - Looks like we're coming up upon an obstacle. Potentially. Hard to say Oh, that's magnetic. - [Jenna] That's what I said, the pole. - You did say the pole. We got to turn around, but there's a Yoda Statue of Liberty over there, which is pretty incredible. What I love about this is it is magnetic. So if there's like a magnet around I could just like stick it on something. And then I just stick it back to my little necklace right here. And then I just take it, put it back on. Now we ready to go. (upbeat music)",
