    "transcript": "- So it's nearing the end of the year. And I feel like this is the time that I start reflecting on life and my top tech of 2021. And I have tested out a lot of tech this year, but this is actually one of the things that I have really been enjoying. I would even say that this is in my top tech of 2021 list. This is the Nextbase, 622GW Dash Cam. A huge thank you to Nextbase for partnering with me on this video. I'm actually really excited about this because I have been using this over the past few months, testing it out and reviewing it. And honestly, my entire perspective on dash cams changed the a first day that I'd mounted this in my car to test it out. There are so many knockoff, unreliable dash cams in the market, and I've just been so hesitant because I've tried so many of these before, and it wasn't until I looked at the footage of this, that it actually just blew my mind. (chill music playing) - Goat, goat. - Shh. - Goat - Shh. Don't scare the goat. - [IJustine] A lot of these other cameras make a lot of different claims about having really great quality being 4k. But a lot of times after I look at the footage, I might as well just mounted a potato in the front of my car and just like, that's it just like cool potato. Actual potato quality. But this has a really amazing 4k quality video with really impressive image stabilization. It also has a polarizer to reduce the glare, especially when you're driving in various sunny conditions, this is super helpful. It also can embed the data into the footage of your speed, your distance, your GPS, and more. And the footage from it is actually so great that I can actually use this in my YouTube videos. I really love that this has an emergency SOS, so it's able to detect if I were to get into a crash and I'm unresponsive. And it's great because this is always recording when I'm in the car. So I always feel like I have this added benefit of safety. Now, you guys, might've seen a few months ago that I had my rental car broken into when I was in Hawaii and this was so traumatic, 'cause I've actually, I've never had this happen to me before. And just to come back and see a car window smashed and my item's gone, was just, it was shocking. If I would have had this installed with the intelligent parking mode enabled, there's a really good chance that I could've caught the person who did this. I may have even been able to get their license plate and then I would have had so much more information to give to the police. And I absolutely love this feature. And it's really cool because also, if somebody bumps your car or hits it, it will automatically turn on and start recording what happened. Now, my friends as a redemption, I just recently went back to Hawaii for a conference and do you know what I did? Oh, you better believe it. I brought this whole setup. We're about to get into the unboxing of this so that I can show you guys everything that comes in the box, but I really wanted to give you kind of like this intro and why I think this is so cool, before we really get into what is in the box. So like I said, redemption and I did not want to run into the situation that had happened previously when I was there. So I brought this with me and kept it in the rental car. And not only did I do this for the benefits of possibly catching another car breaking criminal, but there was so much beautiful scenery, and I was able to capture that. One of the things that I'm most impressed with, is how this is able to lock key moments that were captured, and then it will record over any old unimportant footage. So you'll never have a full SD card. Also, this is kinda cool, by having a dash cam, you can most likely get a discount on your insurance if you have one of these installed in your car. So if you do have one of these or you plan on getting one, definitely check with your insurance company and see if this is a possibility. Also since getting this, I did get a new car and I did get a Tesla. And of course, yes, it does have the built in camera and it has recording software, it has the sensory mode. But honestly this thing integrates so well with the iPhone. And the interface is so incredible. You can actually view all of the footage that is recorded. You can connect to this directly. You can scrub through, you can save. And honestly, that is something that I really, really like. So I think you guys get the gist. This thing is awesome and I'm super excited about it. And I would love to hear from you guys though, do you have any experiences with dash cams? Do you have one of the Nextbase dash cams? I would love to hear it in the comments below. But now this video is basically just getting started. Let's hop into the unboxing, so I can show you guys everything that this comes with and all of the really cool accessory options that you have. This is the Nextbase, 622GW dash cam. Now I didn't realize how exciting a dash cam was until I took this on a road trip to Vegas. It has all kinds of intelligent features, but honestly, as a vlogger and somebody who was always capturing content, this actually will record a 4k video. And what's even more exciting is it's modular. Okay, this is cool. Check this out. I can actually attach this rear view camera and I can not only record in front of me, but I can also record inside of the cabin. And inside of the app, you can go through and there's all kinds of customization settings. This has so many fun features, not only for safety, but like for content creators, this is amazing. 4k, it also has digital image stabilization, which is really impressive. So to really make everything work, you're gonna need one of these. This is the actual dash cam itself. Like I said, shoots in 4k. What? The crazy thing is, I've already unboxed this, used it, but I'm doing this unboxing in like a whole other light because I've already used this and I know how incredible it is. That I'm even more excited unboxing it now than I was the first time. You have got some instructions. Having the Alexa integration is actually really cool too. Here is the dash cam. Does have a touch screen. They do recommend charging it for two full hours before you actually do use it. And this lets you attach this to the click & go mount. This is actually pretty awesome because you can just wire this directly to your car and then you don't have to have any wires directly connected to this. Oh my gosh, so many little goodies. They also supply you with your adapter for the car, so you can keep that fully charged. They also give you some sticky mount options. So here's everything that comes in the box. You have our mounts and our power. And of course you have the actual dash cam, which makes everything happen. I got my USB power up here and this is a little HDMI port. So you just connect that right here and that'll give you the reverse image so you'll be able to film yourself or whatever's happening inside of your car. This was so fun 'cause it was filming outside the window and then Jenna and I were both inside. Are you goin' the speed limit Jenna? - Yeah - Because if you're not, we're all gonna know because this has the speed limit burned into it. You can turn it on or off. It also has GPS overlay and it's kinda cool dude. - That's really cool. I mean, I feel like having this, like if something does happen, like this is evidence. - It is, it's evidence. - This is, indisputable evidence. - The evidence is here and Jenna is going one mile over the speed limit. - So next we have the rear window camera and this actually comes with a very long cable. Look at this super long cable and our little rear window mount. It's really cute. This was so much fun on our road trip because it really did give us sort of like this added camera angle that we normally wouldn't have had. I was honestly so impressed, not only with the video quality, but the possibilities of this for various scenarios. For safety on the road. If you get into an accident or you witness an accident. And one of the really cool things that I like a lot about it is you can connect it to your phone and you can actually view the footage on the app. You can also export footage from there and you can change various settings. And I'm such a huge fan of the app. And it's really great that that integrates so well with this. - [Jenna] So this is where we go? - That's where we go. Dash cam recording. We've got the speed on now, baby. (car engine whirring) (screams) Wow, wow, wow, wow! (music playing) - Is that a mall? Look, there's a mall. - Did you want to go to the mall? - I forgot my shoes. (music playing) Can I drive up here? - Yeah. Pull it up. - [Jenna] Am I getting whistled? - I don't know. - [Jenna] Okay. Keys. - Well, we freakin' made it. Well, thank you guys so much for watching. I hope you guys enjoyed this little look at the Nextbase Dash Cam. This thing is honestly so impressive and I'm so excited that I got a chance to check this out and show it to you guys. I'll put a link in the description where you can learn more or get your own. And I look forward to seeing what you guys think. If you already have one of these, please leave some comments below. I'd love to hear from you. If you guys haven't subscribed already, do hit the subscribe button and hit the bell, so you'll be notified when I post new videos. And as always, I'll see you guys in the next video. (chill outro music playing)",
