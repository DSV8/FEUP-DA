    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going? So I'm with my new friend Jack, here. - iJack. - iJack, there's already one of those. - What, no. - Yup, there is, sorry, it's okay. So, what are we doing right now, because we're in Austria, and I don't live here. Do you live here? - I definitely don't live here. We're here launching the new. - Okay, don't make fun. So I've been calling jaguar, jaguar because that's how we say it in America. How do you guys say it? - Unfortunately, in Britain we say the jaguar. - Jaguar. - (Laughing) Jaguar. - (Laughing) The jaguar. - Good British accent, that is a strong British accent. - It's here for the j-- (laughing) - No, okay, it went bad very quickly. - We were co-hosting this really fun live-stream, and it was the launch of the new I-PACE Ja- - Jaguar. - No, now I have a complex! - Just call it the I-PACE. - The I-PACE, it's a new electric vehicle. We're really excited about it. But we're going to do something really fun. We did one of these on your channel, where you were telling me British slang- - Yes. - And I didn't do that well. - Oh, I feel like by the end of it, though, it was good experience. You've learned a lot of British slang, and when you come to the UK next, if you ever get drunk, you're going to have so many words to describe it. - I will be fully prepared. Well go check that video out on his channel. I'll put a link in the description, but now it's your turn. - Okay. - Do you spend much time in the States at all? - Oh, I am constantly trying to break America. - Oh, okay. - Thus far, I haven't made a dent. - Okay. - But this could be the opportunity. - This could be it, depending upon how well you do. Also, this is something else that we've been talking about. He doesn't drive either. - No. - So-- - Which is problematic in LA. - Yeah, it is definitely problematic. - You have to drive in LA. - You do. - No one walks in LA. - Well no one's going to let you in unless you get some of these right. So let's look at a couple of these. Um, couch potato. - A potato that you consume whilst sat on your sofa. - Mm, no. Do you wanna like, think-- - A couch potato, a potato, a potato, because a couch is a relaxing place. - Yes. - It's a potato you eat, and when you eat it, you just feel like you're home and you're sat on the couch. It's a wonderful, warming, homely potato. - Uh, well, no, it's actually a lazy person who spends the bulk of their time engaged in things that can be done - So close. - While sitting on the couch. So you were halfway there. - So close. - We'll give you a half point. - Okay, half a point. I should do an advert for potatoes or some, for that Whole Foods, when I talk about potatoes. - Do you guys have Whole Foods? - Yeah, we've just got that. - Oh, welcome. - Game-changing. - It really is great. - I mean, I've never seen so much quinoa. - (laughing) There's a lot of quinoa. Give a ring. - Give a ring? - Yeah. - To propose, to give a ring. - No, well, yes, but no, - To give a ring. - This is a different, to give a ring. - To call someone. - Yes! - Yes, give a ring. - Yes, yes, yes. Hyped. - Hyped, like up for it, buzzing, excited, hyped. Hype man. - Yup, a very excited state. I just tweeted, I had some really great spaghetti the other day and I said I was hyped for spaghetti. - Really? - It's really a dumb story; I'll just move on. - No, but, no, it was a wonderful anecdote. - I was only thinking 'cause the tweet was I'm hyped for spaghetti. - I'm hyped up not hyped up to spaghetti, all those carbs. - You don't like spaghetti? - No, quinoa all the way. - (gasps) I'm shook. Do you know what shook means? - Shook? - Yeah, like, \"Oh, I'm shook.\" - No, is this a test? This is one of them? - This is actually. This is what the kids say in the U.S now. - Shook? - Yeah, it's like a big thing. - I'm shook, as in, I'm ah annoyed. - More like shocked. - Shocked, okay, okay, so I'm shook. - Yeah, so it's \"Oh, I'm shook!\" - I'm shook. - Piece of cake. - Oh, easy. - That's exactly what it means. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, um, plead the fifth. - I beg your pardon? - Plead the fifth. - Plead the fifth? - Yes. - Is this an American football thing? - I don't know, is it? - The fifth quarter, the fifth. - The fifth quarter? - Is that a, oh no, you can't have a fifth quarter! You definitely can't have a fifth quarter. - It's okay, no, you can't, but it's okay. - Oh my god. - That would be overtime. - Can we please cut that bit? Fifth quarter! (laughing) No, quarters are four, four, Jack! They're four, you bleeding-- - There's definitely not a lot of you, you're going to get to customs or something and be like, \"Uh, plead the fifth.\" - Plead the fifth, something to do with the constitution? - Yes. - The fifth amendment. - Yes! - But what is the fifth amendment? (Justine gasping) - Is it one of the weird ones, like you can't steal someone's cattle? And so, no? Are there weird amend, I don't know the ten command, not commandments! - (laughing) Oh, god, what is happening? - Not commandments, not the commandments. I know so little about American politics. And I saw Hamilton! I left Hamilton, I was so confused! I just sang the, oh, I should have focused. - Okay, so- do you want me to tell you? - Yes, I'm desperate | - You want me to give you like use it in a sentence? - For you to tell me. - Put me out of my misery. - The fifth amendment allows a witness in court to refuse questions on grounds that they risk self-incrimination. If I spilled the milk and my mom was like, \"Who spilled the milk, Justine, who spilled it?\" I plead the fifth. - Because you don't want to say. - Yes, because then I would be self-incriminating myself. - Yeah, pass the buck would be another one. - Pass the buck? - Fresh. - Is that an amendment you guys have? - No, it's not an amendment, we don't have amendments. We don't have these kind of laws. - You should think about it. - Just respect the queen. - That's pretty good. - That's about it. - Zonked. - Zonked, drunk? - No, you could be zonked from getting too drunk. - Beaten up? - Mm, well, probably, potentially could have been. - Yeah. - No, wow, I'm so zonked from running a marathon. - Tired. - Yeah, exhausted. - Exhausted, tired, good. - I'm just reading off of a list that I found, and this one says pants. Like, do you have pants on? - Yes. - Does that mean something bad? - [Crew Woman] Well, I think-- - There's a thing with pants. - Oh no, I didn't read the rest of the paragraph! What do you call pants? - Um, trousers. - Okay. - Underpants. - Okay. - Although, weirdly, my dad calls them knickers. He's a 78-year-old man and he refers to my, not my knickers, but he calls them knickers. He's like, where, your knickers are on the floor, pick them up. That sounds really weird. As in, like, if he's, when I was-- - We'll go to the next one. (coughs) - When I was a kid, in my bedroom, if my bedroom was in a mess, he was like, pick up your knickers. But they're not knickers. Girls wear knickers, boys wear underpants. - Well whatever you choose to wear is totally up to you. - I can't believe I just said the phrase, \"My dad said pick up your knickers.\" - Spill the beans. I think you already did. - I know that, spilled the beans, that's- - You just did, you just told us some secrets. - Spilled the beans. - So that's great. - Beans well and truly spilled everywhere. - Take a rain check. - That's like, oh I can't see you, because they need to take a rain check. Like, it's a, we'll do it, but we'll do it another time. - Yes, yes, that's good. Jonesing. - Is it to do with Tom Jones? Sex bomb. - I don't know what that is. - Tom Jones, the singer, the Welsh singer. - Yeah, I don't know. ( Jack gasping) - (gasping) Sing, sing a bit. Sex bomb, sex bomb, you're my sex bomb. Oh yeah, I've heard that one. You can (mumbles) when you need to turn me on. - He's like, really famous. I - Play Tom Jones. - Oh my god, that's amazing. - It's like really super futuristic. I'm going to use all of my data for this. (\"It's Not Unusual\" by Tom Jones) Oh yeah, I've definitely heard this. - This is Jonesing. - No. - No? - No. It's not unusual to be loved by anyone - I know this one! - Got the hairiest chest you've ever seen. Not unusual to have fun with - I don't want to get a copyright strike. So I don't even know how many we did, but maybe we'll do one more. - One more, what does jonesing mean? - Oh, I forgot to tell you. So, say my sister has a really great purse and I'm like, I'm jonesing for that purse. - Oh, jealous. - Yeah, kind of, or like, you want something that somebody else has. - Jonesing for it. - Yeah, okay, one more. - Sorry, that's Tom Jones' lawyer. - (laughing) Stop. - We, I'm so sorry, we won't actually play the song in the video, don't worry. - The last one is, this is actually perfect, ride shotgun. - Ride shotgun? - Yes. - Um, is that like a-- - Nothing to do with bad things, no. - Nothing to do with a gun, yeah. Oh. Shotgun, the seat! - It's something that you have to do - Ride in the-- - All the time. - Yes! I ride in the passenger seat because I can't drive. I ride shotgun. - That's incredible. Well guys, that is the end of this wonderful YouTube video. What even happened? I'm not sure. But we also - I learned so much. Did this on your channel too, and I'm fearing to watch it. But yeah, what's your channel? - My channel? - Yeah, is that where you're posting this, like, on your channel? - Well it was gonna be called iJack but, (laughing) clearly that's taken so it's just Jack Whitehall. - Okay. Well I'll put it in the description so they can find it. Bye guys! - Bye! - Wow. (playful music)",
