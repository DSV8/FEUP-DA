    "transcript": "- Yeah, guys. What's going on? I'm feeling a little silly. I've been in the house for a very, very, very long time. And I'm finally going to be leaving and traveling to see my family for the first time in seven months. I got my COVID test, I'm negative. And then I'm gonna take another test as soon as I get home. This is all bringing me to the fact that I wanna vlog my trip there. And I just got this phone in the mail to check out. This is the Xiaomi 10T Pro. A huge thank you to Xiaomi for sponsoring this video. Yeah you got the Xiaomi, Xiaomi, Xiaomi, Xiaomi, Xiaomi... Yeah, I'm here for all of the remixes. The specs on this thing just sounds absolutely crazy. 108 Megapixel AI camera, 8K with Optical Image Stabilization. Up to 144 Hertz Adaptive Sync True Color display. Qualcomm Snapdragon 865, a 5000 MilliAmp Battery, with 33 Fast Watt charging, and 5G. Let's open it up, get packing and go home. Because I have to get on a flight very soon, very, very soon, and I'm not ready. That's one thing that hasn't changed. I was so excited to use my knife that I just realized it had a spring loaded Deployment. But I don't need it. This is the Mi 10T Pro. 5G! Oh, look at that. We've just, we've lifted up the whole thing. It's all here. Look at that. Oh that is a, that is like a jet black. (screen protector peeling) (upbeat music playing) Alright. Oh, don't forget the 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G. Alright, we have a SIM card, I'ma pop on those in, charge this up, set it up. And then we are gonna get on our way. Oh, the typing feels nice. Screen looks incredible. And I'm only at the Wi-Fi set up. And it still looks great. It has a nice feel to it. USB-C cable. You're for the wrong country. I won't hold it against you, I have adapters. What's in here? Oh, look at this little protective case. Oh, and a little dongle. That's a case. What this really needs is a cleaning cloth. Oh my goodness. I'm so smudgy. I definitely would prefer to not have a case on it, but I'm traveling and I would like to keep this nice and protected. Okay, I'm gonna finish my set up, start packing, and take you guys along for, I guess what is gonna be my first time traveling. Very long time. On our way to pick up Jenna. Alex was kind enough to take us to the airport. I didn't even get a chance to film any of my packing. I've been up since like 5:00 AM. Finished the podcast, uploaded it, packed, and now we're on our way. Thank you so much for taking us. - Of course! - We were really afraid of getting in an Uber. So, this works out great. (Alex laughing) I'll give you money. - No, don't give me money. - I'm gonna give you money. - No, don't give me money. - I'm gonna give you money. - No just, just give me five stars. - Five stars! (Alex laughing) Matty, are you ready? Hi, Jenna. - What's that? - Yup. - Are you vlogging? - Yes I am. Oh my gosh. We have so much stuff. (Alex laughing) Hi Matty. - I think I'm more shook about the vlog. - Yeah I know. Jenna hi. - Hi. - We're almost to the airport. This is the first time we've traveled in - Seven months. - Seven months. Matty Hi. - Also seven months. Wait no, longer. - Probably 'cause he didn't go to Hawaii. - Bring it back. We have to let them know, probably the holidays. - Yeah. Hi Matty be a good boy. - [Announcer] Learn more about LAX's effort to combat COVID-19 at flylax.com/travelsafety - I'm smiling - [Announcer] Together we can reduce the spread of germs and ensure healthy... - Germs. - Oh my god, its so weird everything is so weird because their tables you can't sit anywhere. What do we do? - We'll go to the gate. - Okay. I'm gonna get a napkin. - [Announcer] Bandana or a vented mask. Those two face coverings are not allowed. If you have either, please see customer service, we'll provide you with a paper mask. - Wow. - [Announcer] We'll make a general announcement for the flight, five minutes prior to the boarding time. - Let's go, buddy. Come on. Let's go potty. Come on. Come on. Go potty, go potty. Good boy. (gentle music) (upbeat music) - Okay so I just realized that I, didn't switch this to shooting 8K. It was still shooting in 1080, and we're at the airport now. I'm trying to figure out what to do with this hair. It's not happening, but we're at a layover. We landed in Denver. So we're here for like an hour. Jenna and Matty sitting on the floor. I just switched everything over to 4K. Whenever you get a new phone, you got to always switch it to a higher resolution. This is 8K content. Show them this is beautiful view we have. I meant the other way - Yeah but there's people, everything's so weird. Let's just look at night. We are almost there. There it is. The ground. the ground. - We made it. Matty is running. Best Buy, express. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Here she goes. (upbeat music) - Hey Jenna. We made it home. - We did. - How long did you sleep today? - I woke up pretty early, but then it took an hour and a half nap. - Yup. Am I in the frame? - Push it this way. - Push it this way. - A little less. - This way - a little more - Push it this way. - There you go. - (laughing) Hi. We made it. I cannot believe what a long day it was. I honestly must say that I really like the six foot rule and I hope that we keep it forever, because I don't want to be close to people. But I want to be close to doggie. Is Matty in the frame? - Up a little. Perfect. - Easy. It's probably not focused. 8K. Oh 8K doggy. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, Matty. He's a good boy. - Good dog.",
