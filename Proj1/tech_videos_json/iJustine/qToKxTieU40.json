    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And today I am unboxing some new smart luggage by Samsara. And I'm so excited about this because they just partnered with Apple to have an integrated AirTag inside of their luggage. And this is incredible because ever since the AirTags first came out I have had one on pretty much every single thing that I own. But in my luggage, I would always just kind of toss it in and it would get mixed up and kind of, I don't wanna say lost, because I could always find the AirTag, but it was never in one general place and it never really had a home. A huge thank you to Samsara for partnering with me on this video. So I may have miscalculated my desk, thinking that I could unbox this here. I think we can do it. Let's lay this down and open it up. The AirTag is right there. It's right there to greet us. This is incredible. If you've never used an AirTag yet. Absolutely love them. Oh my gosh, it's the yellow luggage. So these do come in three different colors. They have a white, a black and this yellow. So pretty! And it even comes with a nice little dust cover as well. Look at that. These locks are TSA compliant which means you can keep everything in your suitcase secure. I really like that this has an aluminum frame and it doesn't have zippers because a lot of times zippers are easy to tamper with. The AirTag is included with your purchase of the suitcase. I'll put a link of the description breaking more information about this luggage. And if you do decide to purchase one of these smart tag suitcases, make sure you use my code ijustine a checkout to receive a packing bag worth $50. Let's open it up, shall we? I like that this has an aluminum frame around it. Zippers are very easily to be tampered with. This feels industrial. So this is the carry-on size and there's also a grand carry-on that's a little bit larger. So I feel like this is gonna be perfect for short trips. And I also pack a lot of technology. So anytime I go on a trip, I end up using a full suitcase and just filling it with gear. And I already like this because this has this separate little zipper side here. And I feel like I'm already kind of envisioning where I'm gonna put things. I am actually going on a trip to Yosemite here very soon. And I'm gonna be packing this up and testing it out and seeing how it works. I can put all my podcast gear here. And what's this? Oh my goodness, there's a whole other bag of goodies. Look at that. Okay. TSA-accepted luggage. Love to see it. Oh, I also love that this has a little strap so that I can strap all of my clothes or gear inside of. I'm excited about what's inside of here because they said that this also has some little packing accessories. I love packing accessories. Like when I pack I'm obsessive, like I make sure everything is perfectly organized. And then when I get to my destination, it all kind of explodes and is an absolute disaster. But the process of getting to my location and then even returning like, I even fold my dirty clothes in a separate little section, so that I can have them all set and ready to do laundry when I get back. This looks like it could be like a little garment kind of cover to like, hang up your suit. Oh yeah, definitely a suit or dresses. So this is pretty cool. I actually, even like this bag too, like I would use this for something. Like maybe laundry or who knows? That's nice. Oh, we've also got these little bags too. I feel like these would be good for shoes, bathing suits. 'Cause I like to keep everything completely separate like I said, like I don't just put everything in. Everything has a special place and I like that these have some additional little bags. Oh my gosh, even a little toiletry bag and it all matches. Check that out. I love like these little yellow accents. This is a really cool bag too. This I would probably use for shoes. And I also like that this has a reinforced bag. So I feel like this is definitely something that I would use shoes for. In my mind, also thinking about packing gear. I always like to have my lenses wrapped in something. So this has this extra little protection here, so I could wrap my lenses up in that. My camera lenses, that is. My gosh and there's a second one. This one doesn't have the reinforced bottom but it is like the same size. What is this little guy? Look at this, this is like a little duffle bag! How great! Another one! One, two, three... Nine! Like we got nine little extra bags that came inside of here. Like this just folds up. It's like basically nothing in there. I'm such a fan of tiny bags. Now the real highlight of this luggage is yes, it is incredible. The quality's awesome. I love these zippers. Everything feels like very premium, but it comes with an AirTag. There it is, an AirTag. Many of you have seen these before. No way, look! It has the little logo on it. So let's set up the AirTag. It's great because all you really have to do with these is bring it close to your phone and hit connect. I definitely recommend setting up this AirTag before you decide to put it inside of your luggage. It's all set up. Let's take a look. See how this goes in here. This just opens up just like so. And then this lifts up, has a clear little window right here, and we just pop in our AirTag. AirTag is in and we're gonna close this little lid and screw this back on. It's so great. I love it. Like this doesn't even look like an AirTag. It just looks like it's their logo. How awesome. Now that we have this all unboxed, I'm gonna pack it up and we're gonna see how everything fits. (energetic music) So I brought my luggage to Yosemite and this is exciting 'cause this is the first time that I actually use it. And I've been using it as a gear luggage storage. So I pretty much have everything in here that I need. My cameras, my lenses, I even have an extra pair of shoes in here right now and all of my podcasting equipment, which is amazing because everything fit in here. And I love the fact that it is a hard-shelled case because everything is nice, safely and secure inside. But the other thing that of course is the highlight for this is it has an integrated AirTag in it. And it looks so cool. And the fact that it has their logo on it. No one's gonna know. They're gonna think this is just a little piece of a logo. - [Woman] I actually didn't know. - [Justine] You didn't? - [Woman] No, I didn't know that was an AirTag. - [Justine] I know, it's an AirTag. - [Woman] That's pretty cool. - [Justine] I know, it's great! So if you're familiar with AirTags, there's a lot of different things that it can do. Obviously it can play a sound so that you can locate your item or there's just the Find My. And because it connects to Bluetooth, you can also use the option where you can walk around and try to find it. So as you can see here, it says three feet nearby. And as I get closer to it, it says here. Pretty great. Thank you guys so much for watching. Hope you guys enjoy this video. And again, the link will be in the description and be sure to use IJUSTINE at checkout. I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye!",
