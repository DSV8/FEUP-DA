    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and we are at the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event and guess what we have here? This is the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. They announced this before the event even happened and they aired a commercial at the Oscars, which was kind of incredible because there were rumors, but the Oscars commercial just confirmed it. And here it is, it's in my hands. (gentle music) So this is the Z Flip. It has a 6.7-inch AMOLED Infinity Flex display with a 1.1-inch AMOLED display on the front. When you double-tap on the power button, which also is a fingerprint sensor, this will activate the selfie camera, so you can take a selfie. Look at that! It also has wireless charging, but it isn't 5G compatible with the rest of the S20s. It's running a Snapdragon 855 Plus. It has eight gigs of RAM, 256 gigs of storage, and 3300 milliamp dual battery. There's two 12 megapixel cameras in the back. There's a wide angle and an ultra-wide angle and on the inside, of course, it has a selfie camera, and that's 10 megapixels. It comes in three different colors. There's mirror purple, black, and gold in some markets. They also have one other version. This is the Thom Browne edition. This one is a limited edition version and they are launching it at New York Fashion Week. So I only get a few minutes with this thing, but what the crazy part about this is this is being released on Valentine's Day, so what a treat to us. You can get it at various retailers and the fact that this is being launched so soon without pre-orders or anything was kind of shocking. When I saw that flash up on the screen, I was like, \"wait a minute, that's just a few days away.\" So my initial impressions is it doesn't feel cheap like I feel like one of the things that when you have a flip phone like this I never really had much time with the Samsung Galaxy Fold but one of the things I like about this is this feels substantial, like when this is in my hand, like, it feels nice. Let me do a pocket test. This isn't a real pocket! What kind of lie is this? - [Jenna] You want to put it in my pocket? - Do you have a pocket? - I have a pocket. - [Justine] In Jenna's pocket, 'cause I don't have one. That's nice. Oh, flex. That's cool. Give me that back! So what's cool about this is different applications will change depending upon how you have the phone. So right now we have the full screen mode, we're watching YouTube, but if we fold this, the video will continue to play up top, but down below you have all of your YouTube comments and you can basically interact with this like a little tiny laptop. It's so cute! You can also do full screen mode. Ta-da! So one of the things I really like is this hinge. It's really stiff so if you were to place this somewhere, it can basically kind of act as a little tripod. They did a little demo at the Keynote where you can take a selfie or you can do Google Duo calls. I like this because it doesn't feel like it's just gonna shut on it's own and speaking of closing it. You have over 200,000 folds, they say. You can tell that there is a little bit of a crease, but this doesn't feel like plastic because it's actually a very, very ultra-thin glass. Do you see me? Do you see it? I just took our picture using the front flip. How cool! So this is just my first look at the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. This is pretty cool. I love the future thoughts of the integration of having foldable phones like this because taking something that is this big, folding it in half, and it is now half the size, I am definitely really into that. I was gonna say that I wish I could do that with my laptop, but technically that's kind of what you're already doing. Well, see you guys later. I'll have some more videos coming out soon. So make sure you like, comment, and subscribe! Make sure to hit the bell and I will see you in my next video. Jenna, your turn. - [Jenna] Thank you! - Oh, I need a thumbnail! - Did you see what colors it comes in? - Yeah, in the VO. (slow electronic music)",
