    "transcript": "- So right now, I'm driving downtown to go do a rehearsal for Vlog University. It's happening tomorrow. Depending on when you're watching it, it might be happening right now, and of course, it's Los Angeles, so there's traffic. (calm piano music) Made it downtown to the convention center. We're about to head in and go start setting up for tomorrow. (calm music) Guys, look, this is the banner. Vlog University is here. This is so exciting. So everything is still being set up for tomorrow. This is our little check in desk. - Whoa, whoa, no filming. No filming. (Justine laughs) - They told me not film because it looks messy and this isn't what it's gonna look like, but I was like, this is us vlogging. This is what we do. We film behind the scenes, but I wanna show you guys, this what I'm really excited about. Okay, come, come, come. We have so much fun Vlog U swag. We have pink water bottles. They had a bunch of different colors, but as soon as I saw this hot pink, I knew immediately we needed this one. We also got a little backpack. Do I look like I'm going to school? (calm music) Vlog U pens. We also have some tote bags. I don't know where I'm going, I'm just walking. (calm music) Here's some of our sponsors, so thank you, guys. Over here is one of the breakout rooms. We're gonna be having panels and sessions, and everything is not set up yet. Oh, wow, look at this. Whoa, there's lots of seats. I'm excited to see this tomorrow. It's gonna be a surprise to me because I don't even know 100% what it's gonna look like. We've seen pictures, we've talked about things, but you never actually know until the day of, so you guys are gonna get to see it. What's over here? Oh, here's another little room. I just keep thinking about how crazy it is that this whole thing started from a little YouTube show that I started 10 years ago. There's still tickets if you wanna get them online, so make sure you check out vloguniversity.com and we're gonna be here all weekend, so hope to see you guys. (calm music) Here's the red carpet. We're gonna roll it out. (low shuffling) (calm music) Do it for the 'gram or the TikTok or the Byte. (Justine laughs) Oh, this is not that fun. (Justine grunts) Got the shot. Roll out Me and my homies Roll out (mellow music) - So here's the theater where the keynote's gonna be happening. I'm so excited. My friend Josh Sundquist, who I'm sure most of you guys know here on YouTube, he's incredible. He's gonna be also doing the keynote and I can't believe it. It's crazy because I met him, oh my gosh, at the first Vidcon. So that fact that he's now here doing the keynote at Vlog University's so great. All right, it's go time. (mellow music)",
