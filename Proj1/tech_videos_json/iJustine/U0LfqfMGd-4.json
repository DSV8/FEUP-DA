    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine, and I am so excited because right now, we are getting a chance to check out the Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray. This thing is absolutely fantastic. Not only do we have a full version here, but we also have a little tearaway one right here, so we can actually get inside and see what it's all about. (upbeat techno music) This is the electric all-wheel drive Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray. The first Corvette was introduced all the way back in 1953, and now 70 years later, they're updating it with electric performance. It's one of the only sports cars that has two separate propulsion systems to provide naturally aspirated V8 power with the electrified responsiveness of electric all-wheel drive. It is the fastest Chevrolet Corvette in history. You can go zero to 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds, and a quarter mile in just 10.5 seconds. Combined, it has 655 horsepower, from both the electric and small block V8 motor. - Hi, I'm Aaron Link. I'm the vehicle performance manager for Chevrolet Corvette. - What do we have here today? - Well, Justine, this is the brand new Chevrolet E-Ray. It's the world's first electrified Corvette and the world's first electric all-wheel drive Corvette. - In front of us, we actually have one that's kind of a cutdown, so we can actually see everything that's going on inside the vehicle. - [Aaron] Right, we have this really tall section here to show how much structure we get out of it, and then the battery pack is four groups of 20 battery cells a piece. - [Justine] Some of the top features are stealth mode, which is a normal everyday street mode, that will get you up to 45 miles per hour in an all electric driving for a period of time before the engine turns on for normal driving. - [Aaron] Moving silently, on its own. - Wow, it's, yeah, completely silent. - [Aaron] So orange is positive torque, and green is like regen torque. So if I hit the brakes here, it's gonna think about charging. If I'm done with that or I exit- (engine roars) - [Justine] Whoa! - Now it's gonna start up. - Okay, I wasn't ready for that! (laughs) - [Aaron] Sorry. - Wow, I mean, that sounds incredible. - [Aaron] If I give a little blip on the intake- (engine roars) - Whoa! Oh, wow. I mean, just to go from stealth mode to that! It's shocking. I mean, this is what everyone has been waiting for. - [Aaron] It is, yeah. We didn't lose the brilliance of what Corvette means, but we've added something to it that's pretty special. - Just wow. It has a lightweight lithium ion 12 volt battery, a standard Brembo carbon ceramic brake system, standard magnetic ride control that has three suspension settings with staggered 20 and 21 inch wheels with Michelin pilot sport all season tires. The electric front motor, in combination with the L2T engine, gives the E-Ray an invigorating sound. - This little system is the battery cooling system, so with the electrification comes three cooling circuits that aren't there on the normal Stingray. The battery here, the powertrain electronics up front, and then the drive unit itself. Up to 45 miles an hour, you can drive in full electric propulsion mode. - So it really only charges through the road. - Yeah, no plugs, no ports or anything, no cables. It basically just charges by spinning the front axle. - Should we get in it? Could we get in it? - We sure can. - Oh, this is exciting. It's like getting into a spaceship. (car door beeping) Oh, oh, wow, we're in! - You're in. You're among the first to ever do this. - [Justine] Much like most newer vehicles, there are a lot of driver assist technologies also built into this. It has lane keep assist with lane departure warning, forward collision alert, and automatic emergency braking. Depending on what mode you select, that will determine the amount of electric assist. There's a few selectable modes, like tour, sport, track, weather, my mode, and Z mode. There's also a charge plus feature, which will maximize the battery's charge. There's so many details, like everything is just, it's, I don't wanna touch anything. (laughter) - [Aaron] The gauges here show engine output and electric output, and so you can measure that in horsepower or torque. And then there's a Dyno feature that's a rolling graph of two minutes down to 15 seconds of how much data you'd want to see at once. And then this has some information that we calculate for you of fuel saved, battery temperature, motor temperature. - [Justine] There's also a ton of customization you can choose from when creating your ideal E-Ray. There's four aluminum wheel finishes, 14 exterior color choices, including this Sea Wolf Gray that is featured here, this new 2024 Riptide Blue, and Cacti. You could also choose the E-Ray exclusive body length stripe package in Electric Blue. - My name is Kurk Bennion, I'm the exterior design manager for Corvette. - So let's talk about this design, because obviously it's incredible. So, what was kind of like, your main focus? - Create a compelling car, you know, that defines a new entry into the marketplace. - So what does this mean for people now, that we can have this extra electric performance? - It gives you all-wheel drive capability. Really good for pulling the car through corners, accelerating, things like that. All weather driving, you know. It puts you at a safer platform. - This color is amazing. - Yes, yes, it's got... - You even mentioned there's like, kind of like some gold? - Yes, it's got a gold flake in it. We've got our most aggressive carbon fiber package here, which gets you carbon fiber around the cluster, the steering wheel, the center console, the door inserts on both sides. - [Justine] There's standard carbon flash badging, black exhaust tips and bright fading, carbon fiber ground effects, and even carbon fiber wheels in carbon flash, visible carbon fiber finish, or visible carbon fiber with a red stripe. - We use it all through the exterior as well. This is our Arrow Package, of course, you know, all Corvettes are heavily tuned and heavily designed in wind tunnels, and that for, you know, high end performance, top speed. - Look at all, like, there's enough storage there for me. - You'll see those lights there? There's RGB light package. - [Justine] Oh, you have to get the RGB light package, for sure. - That allows you to tune the colors of how you want to the engine scene. You can see we've got this floating glass idea here, this helps hot air get out there. - The E-Ray also introduces the all new Artemis Dipped interior, which has deep green tones on almost all of the interior surfaces and will be available on all 2024 Corvettes. So top speed 180. - Yes. - That's pretty fast. This was such an incredible experience. Like, I have been following this car for quite a while, so the fact that I'm sitting here behind the wheel. Wouldn't it be so fun if we could just take it out on the street right now? - [Camera Man] Let's go! - Well, let's go! This is absolutely beautiful. I am such a huge fan of carbon fiber, too. Look at this all! Look, we've got some things in here. Gotta keep this card in the vehicle. Okay, this is what I was worried about. Like, how much cup holder space are we going to have? Two drinks, we're set. Here's the little switching wheel that'll take you into the different modes. Heated seat, yes, please. Like it has a little home! Oh, it's so cute. Well, that was it! That was the first look here at the E-Ray and I am so hyped about this. I mean, I hope that one day, I can take this actually out for a little drive and test it out. I'm actually kind of speechless. Like this is really, really freaking cool. 180 miles an hour. I can't even fathom that. Well, thanks again for watching. If you guys haven't already, please hit subscribe and like this video, and hit the bell to be notified when I post new videos, and leave a comment below and let me know what you think and which color would you choose? Okay, here we go, no keys. Push to start. (engine roars) Oh, okay, we've got to try the horn! (horn beeps) I don't want them to run out of gas. They're already really low and you can't just like roll up to a gas station with this! (upbeat techno music)",
