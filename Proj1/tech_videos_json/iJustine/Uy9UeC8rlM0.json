    "transcript": "- Today, we are taking a look at the first new Mac devices with the brand new M1 chip. We have the new Macbook Air, the Macbook Pro, 13 inch, and the Mac Mini. M1 is Apple's first chip, in their family of chips that are being built in house, that will slowly, over the next two years, replace intel. But don't worry, if you do have an intel Mac, or you're buying one right now, it will still be supported. But what this new M1 chip means, is Apple will now be able to optimize for smaller and more power efficient Macs. So first, let's start with the Macbook Air. This has a starting price of 999, or if you have an education discount, you can get it for 899. So this Macbook can be configured with 16 gigs of ram, a new, two terabyte solid state drive that is two times faster than before. It'll have five times faster graphics, 3.5 times faster CPU and up to 18 hours of battery life. The display is an 18.3 inch P3Y color retina display. It also has improved FaceTime camera and it also has Thunderbolt and USB4. All white being completely silent, there are no fans in this thing. That's one of the things that I'm really looking forward to testing out. How silent are you? It's just so small, it's so wow. What the heck, that was shocking. It's turning on, it's doing it's thing, it's doing it's thing, oh my gosh, the set up, the set up. It's crazy that I do so much with tech and still, every time I open something, anything, it's just such an exciting experience. Getting a new device, just always makes me even more excited for the future. Even though I know that I should be enjoying the thing that's in front of me right now. These M1 Macs are setting up the future of Mac hardware, as we know it, it is changing everything. Also in the box, we've got our charger. Look at this little baby charging brick. My 16 inch Macbook, the charging brick is so massive. Less power consumption means smaller charging bricks, means all around good time. (crunching) I love that we're instantly, oh my God, look at this, is this not the most innovative, top down experience, you guys have ever seen. I love that the first screen is about accessibility. Apple has been doing so much as far as accessibility is concerned, and the fact that this is the first screen that you are greeted with, is such a step in the right direction. Oh you want me to set up tough ID? All right, so I cannot wait until they integrate face ID into their Macbooks, which I feel like, is probably coming very soon. Especially because they're now building these M1 chips in house, and they're able to store so much more on these devices, as far as like security. It'll be here before we know it, I have faith. And if I'm wrong, well I'm wrong, I don't care, I don't mind being wrong. Like a snappy, super snappy, like look at this, look at this, snappy, let's open something. Let's open music, very fast, podcasts, very fast. I do plan on going more in depth in each one of these devices, but this is kind of just a little unboxing and a first look. So, Macbook Air, check. Next up, maybe let's go with the Mac Mini, shall we? The Mac Mini has a starting price of 699, which is one of the least expensive Macs you can currently buy. Now it doesn't come with a display, a keyboard or a mouse, but still, you're getting a Mac for 6.99, so if you already have a keyboard, already have a display, already have a mouse, you've got a pretty great deal here. You're gonna be getting a three times faster CPU, with an eight core GPU, for six times faster graphics. It has ethernet, USB4 and Thunderbolt, HDMI 2.0. This also has pro display XDR support, so if you happen to have Apple's $6000 monitor, you will be able to take full advantage of it. Oh wow, look it, man the Mac Mini is just so cool. Like it's just a small, little, just compact, powerful beast. I feel like the Mac Mini, is gonna be really great for people who are kind of realizing that work from home is now just gonna be called work. Like you're just working. Being able to connect this to a full display, being able to have all of that power inside of this little device, which also looks incredible. Like I like the fact that they decided to go with this silver color, for this Mac Mini, this time around. (upbeat music) There you freaking are, what else do we have in here? Oh, a single power adaptor, this is very small. Here's the previous Mac Mini, this is the more graphite color. It is interesting though, because this has four USBC Thunderbolt ports and this new one only has two. I was also hoping that they would put a 10 gigabit ethernet port, but they didn't, which I feel like a lot of people do use these as render farms or as networking devices, so that would've sorta made some sense. Definitely think it would've been nice, if they would've been able to still put four ports on here in the back, but obviously this one is just Thunderbolt three, so they aren't getting pro display XDR supports and faster regrade speeds with these. But I will definitely be testing these out further. So let me know if there's anything that you guys would like me to test out with this, just leave it in the comments below. So next up, we have the new Macbook Pro 13 inch. Now this has 2.8 times faster CPU, five times faster GPU, and the longest battery life ever, on a Mac. They said that you can get over 17 hours of wireless web browsing, and 20 hours of video playback. That's a lot of time, if you really think about it. How much time does this mean for me, being able to edit 4K footage. I mean, we're gonna figure it out, 'cause maybe I will edit this video on here or maybe Tyler will be editing this video on this Mac, TBD. (laughing) I've never used a 13 inch Macbook Pro before, until the last one that came out, when I was reviewing that one. And it was an incredible experience. Just that size and form factor, and the power that you're getting in such a small device, is really, really exciting. And that's why I'm even more excited about this. Now, I don't necessarily travel as much as I used to, so having this as my everyday device, is probably not as realistic as it was before, but what's cool, is this is very, very powerful, and you can also connect this to a display. So I think that's where it kinda comes in, it's like do you wanna be paying more for a laptop, or do you just wanna get a Mac Mini, connect it to a display and just be done with it. (gasping) Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'd say this is a thick boy, but it's really not, but in comparison to the Air, maybe. Hello, welcome to my home, make yourself comfortable, please make yourself comfortable at the door. I gotta stop talking to my devices when they're not turned on, because can't even answer me. USBC cable, a little bit bigger of a charging brick, for our more powerful machine. This doesn't have an Apple logo on it. I mean it does, but this one has a nice little cut out, Mac logo It's fine I'm not mad, I've just never noticed it before. Auto on, auto on, auto on, holy moly, you beautiful baby. I don't like assigning gender to my devices, but I can't help it, I just sometimes do. What a snappy, snappy little device. (clicking) Did you know that the sound of snapping your fingers is not actually the action of snapping. The sound is actually your finger hitting the palm of your hand. My entire life changed when I found that out. (typing) Why is that the image you decided that I wanted? That cactus, that's what you chose for me? Hey (beep) open the documents folder. Hey (beep) what does the rest of my day look like. You guys are basically the same freaking size. You're friends, you're best friends. God this is so thin, it's shocking how thin this is. I know one of the biggest questions that a lot of people are having, especially if you're not incredibly tech savvy, is which one would be right for me? I think it just really comes down to, what are you gonna be using these devices for. Obviously with the 13 inch Mac Pro, it's a more powerful machine. So if there is a chance that you are gonna be doing more processor intensive things. Like editing high resolution photos or video, then it really is a no brainer that the Mac Pro is the way to go. But that's not the takeaway. From how powerful they were able to make this Air, and I am so excited to really get a chance to test this out. So here you guys have it, these are the first devices with the brand new Apple, M1 chip. I'm so excited about the future and I know I'm just trying to just be present and enjoy what we have right now, but this is really a step in an incredible direction for Apple, and I'm very excited to test these out further and really just see what we can push the limits to, on all three of these. If you guys are new here, welcome to my channel, thank you so much for watching until the end of this video. Make sure you subscribe and hit the bell, so you'll be notified when I post a new video. I have a lot more fun content coming up for you guys, so I guess I'll just stop talking and see you in the next one, bye. (singing) Mac, Mac baby.",
