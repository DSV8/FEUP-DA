    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and we are here at WWDC and right now we are checking out Memoji and I'm super excited about this. When they announced this at the event I was (gasp) I was so excited 'cause this is something that I've been waiting for. So right now we're going to go through and we're gonna create it and first we're gonna choose my skin. We'll go for the skin color. You can choose from all of these various colors. There are so many different options that you can choose from. It's pretty overwhelming. You can choose from freckles. And as you can see this is face tracking me the entire time. Let's click for a hairstyle. Here's the problem, I have blond hair but my eyebrows are not the same color. - [Jenna] Is your hair blond? - It's, of course it's all natural, Jenna. Obviously. So today I have curly hair so we're gonna try to find a nice curly hairstyle color. But look how many hairstyle options that there are. Like, this is overwhelming. Oh that, oh. This mohawk actually looks good. Think that's something I might want to consider for my future. Okay, that's a little too curly. I don't really wear ponytails. I like that, that's a nice wave. (gasp) Can you see that? Like my hair is bouncing. Not in real life but in, in emoji life. Kay, so we've got my hairstyle. I think it's a pretty accurate color. Oh, I can get highlights. That looks good, oh, ooh. Uh, mmm, oh no that's age. So here, look how young I look. Young and vibrant. I'm gonna pick the middle one. How about this one? These face shapes. Kinda looks like me. Right? Okay, my eyes, I'm not sure what color my eyes are. What color are they? - [Jenna] Green. - Green, okay, cool. - [Jenna] I think. - I think so too. Okay, let's see. What eyes, what do my eyes look like? I think that looks like me, ooh. Oh yeah, ooh add some lashes. Oh this looks great, okay. That's me, now I can pick my brows. Oh my gosh, this is so cool. Oh my gosh, nose and lips? Let's see a nose. That looks good. Lips, do a little pink. Actually, I like purple, that looks good. Or do I like pink? There's different lip sizes too? Okay, those lips are way too big. I need to turn down. There's now tongue detection so. Oh my goodness, this is incredible. Okay ears, let's see. I'm trying to move my hair and I was thinking that it was gonna work in the app but not yet. Wow, there's all kinds of piercings. Okay, that looks good, we're gonna do that with a nice rose gold because, hello. Facial hair? Not today. But there are all of these options. Look how many there are. It's like overwhelming. I think I look good with that. (giggles) Look at my beard. My goatee? Okay, not today. (gasp) You can pick sunglasses. You can pick all these various glasses. Actually lost my glasses so I haven't worn them for a very long time. But you can also get lenses so you can make them be just regular clear glasses or tinted. Can put hats on? Look at your different colored hats. Look at that, I'm gonna wear a pink hat. Okay it's an option but I'm not gonna do it. So I'm gonna hit done. And there I am! (gasps) Wow, okay, I'm gonna record a little message. Hey this is my first memoji. What do you guys think, how do I look? Hmm? Aah, I think it looks pretty good. Okay, bye. Just kidding, 'cause I have 30 seconds now so I can keep going. This is great. So in the camera icon, in the messages app, there's this little star right here so when you click that, that will bring up this whole little area here so you can choose from your memojis, oh my gosh, this is so cool. Look at this, okay I'm gonna take a picture. So let's pick it. There we go. So I can also pick a filter so let's do the comic book one because that is very, very nice, okay? I'm also gonna throw a sticker in here as well. How about, ooh an ice cream cone? Now picture. (laughs) This is incredible. Oh my goodness. I am sending this to some random account on this phone. So I hope that they enjoy my content 'cause it's pretty great. Well guys, I think that is it for Memoji. I'm super excited for this. There's been so many fun announcements and of course as always, I will be posting a video. So, stay tuned. I'll see you guys later. Bye. Hey, it's ijustine. I'm a memoji. I'm having so much fun, this is so cool. Aah. Blaah? Tongue detection, it's a thing. Okay bye. (electronic rhythm music)",
