    "transcript": "(upbeat electro music) - And here it is, it's the Mavic Mini, this thing is so incredibly cute, like I can't even handle it and it's so light. It is so light in fact that you do not have to register it with the FAA. So that's one of the newest drone laws, is if you have an unmanned aircraft that is more than 250 grams, you have to make sure that you register it to legally be able to fly it. So this is ironically 249 grams. It's crazy how small this is, like it's smaller than my iPhone 11 Pro Max. The max distance that this will fly with the controller is two and a half miles and it has a 30 minute maximum flight time on just a single charge. It has a micro USB port for charging and it supports 18 watt fast charging. For photos it's 12 megapixels and the max resolution for video is 2.7k, so you can shoot in 25 or 30 frames a second. But if you switch it to full HD, you can shoot 1920x1080, 25, 30, 50, and 60 frames a second. It has both GPS and downward sensors for vision positioning, so it can hover both indoors and outdoors. There's also some snap prop guards which are best used indoors in case you hit something. I love DJI's quick shots, much like other drones, it has the usual rocket, drony, circle, and helix camera moves. It also has this newly redesigned DJI Fly app, the viewing area is 20% larger if you compare it with the DJI GO 4 app. I feel like this drone is really being aimed at beginners, but if you're an experienced drone pilot, I think this is gonna be super fun for us. This is the case, I love this thing so much because you can basically fit everything in it. You've got your drone, you've got your battery charger, and the controller but, underneath of it, you can fit your cables and I have some extra prop guards. I love this controller because the joysticks are removable and this is probably one of my favorite features the DJI finally started integrating in the past few versions of their drone controllers. This makes it so much easier for storage. This is the battery charger, which out of all the things that DJI has ever made, like I really never have that many negative things to say, but this battery charger is so incredibly difficult to get the batteries out of. Like, am I doing something wrong, I don't understand? But once you get the batteries out, you can get 30 minutes of flight time. (upbeat electro music) I just wanna go on record saying that, right now this is probably my favorite drone to date. The size of the quality, and even flying it, like it was super smooth, it's not too windy out today but even so, like, I was flying really quickly. I was in sport mode. All right let's go somewhere else. (upbeat electro music) I'm gonna test out the Senna Smooth feature. This isn't something that's new but, I really usually never fly like this because I like to fly quick and fast and in sport mode, you can make big movements but it doesn't allow you to actually go that fast. So it keeps everything very cinematic and very smooth, hence the name Senna Smooth. (upbeat electro music) My little baby! Come here, come here! (upbeat electro music) So we're back in Catalina, and now I've got all of my indoor accessories to play with. We've got the Mavic Mini DIY creative kit and I have my prop guards already on, I just did a quick test flight, just to see how it flew around the house and it was pretty awesome. So these prop guards just snap on fairly easy, so they just go on each side to protect your propellers, you will definitely hit things in your house, like that's, unless you're like an incredible pilot, I don't even care, you're probably gonna hit something, because you can't really see up or down when you're flying so I kept hitting the ceiling, cause' I was sitting downstairs and I flew it upstairs so, the only view that you have obviously is from your controller. Let's open this up, I really don't even know what this is gonna look like, we've got some crayons, markers, these are probably markers, I wouldn't imagine they would give you crayons to decorate the faceplate with. We've got a wide variety of colors, we've got a yellow, blue, a red, a black, and a green. Oh, they're like little stickers. This is cool, so you can color it, it also has some blank ones. I mean, look how cool that's gonna look. Lemme just do a really quick illustration, just to see how these markers write on it because honestly, that's one of the things that I would wanna know if I was watching this video. Oh, it writes actually pretty nice. My review of the markers is actually, I would say probably like an eight outta ten. But we gotta test all the colors. That's terrible, that's disgusting. That's absolutely terrible. I juce t tin, I juce tin (laughs) all right this is honestly, this is embarrassing but I'm gonna put it on my drone. So I think we have to clean our drone first, probably should have turned it off so I should have saved battery. But the battery on this thing is amazing. The whole time we were in Catalina, I was really surprised at how much battery life we ended up getting with this. Wow! Oh God, I'm shaking, I had too much caffeine. Okay. Oh, I've messed up. Okay, you guys get the point, it's beautiful. Okay, let's take off, I'll just take off right here, why not? So right now we have another shoot happening as well, we're setting up for something really cool, we're shooting a bunch of really cool 180 videos. So this entire place has just been, I mean, there's just stuff everywhere, like it's a mess. You guys will see very shortly. (drone rotors whine) Whoa! I'm really, thoroughly enjoying this so far. Oh my gosh, guys there we are. This looks like an actual hurricane has gone through this place. (drone rotors whining) I'm driving it pretty quickly, through this house Oh! So, okay, it would be this way. Right there! (laughs) You guys wanna go to the laundry room? Okay! Laundry. Oops, I hit the wall, it's okay. (drone rotors whining) This is handling really well inside. (drone rotors whining) Oopsie! (laughs) Oh God! (tense orchestral music) No, that's terrifying! Oopsies! That's okay! Let's get upstairs and see Jenna. Oh, I gotta go up. Oopsies. Oops. Oh boy, we've hit some stuff I know it. (slow tense drumming) Oh, oh! I can't tell where I am! Hi! There's Jenna. Okay, this definitely helped, taking it out of sport mode. Jenna's doing an unboxing here. Okay, let's go back downstairs! (tense music) Sorry! (laughs) So, I don't know how that went. (drone rotors whining) (tense music) I'm gonna fly it really fast in here. Okay, are you ready? Okay, I'm just gonna hit forward, it's gonna go real fast. Holy crap! (laughs) That was incredible! (drone rotors whining) (tense music) - [Man] What happened? - I hit it really hard. (slow tense music) Here we go. And we're back. (drone rotors whine) and we're perfect. (slow dramatic music) Okay, wow. I don't know what was happening upstairs. So that's a first look at the Mavic Mini and honestly, I love this thing so much. Now, the quality that you're getting from this is obviously not gonna be that of the Mavic Pro or anything like that, because it's not 4K, it's a smaller sensor, and this is something that is a little more geared towards beginners but, all in all, if I'm traveling and I just wanna get some cool drone shots on a hike or something like that, this is great, I love that it has these prop guards. I was able to fly really well inside and I think if you're looking for a cool, small, little tiny drone that will get you some cool aerial shots, like, this is it, like, I don't think that there's anything else out there like this right now. And especially cause' it's DJI, it's like their software, everything. No, there's nothing else out there like this. And I'm hyped. That's the end of the video so, see you guys later. I'll put a link in the description. (upbeat electro music)",
