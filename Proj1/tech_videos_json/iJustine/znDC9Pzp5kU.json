    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today we are checking out a little something here from Sony. I'm really excited about this. These are the Sony console faceplates. These are the official ones from Sony. I have two colors here. We've got the Cosmic Red and the Midnight Black. Now, I was one of the people that was like super fan girl. Like, I absolutely loved the white PlayStation console. Now that I'm kind of like looking at my setup that I have. All my consoles are all black, except for the new Nintendo switch dock, which is white, which actually was kind of working out because there was a nice little alternating pattern happening there with the PlayStation. This is gonna look a lot better and a lot sleeker inside of there. We've also got the new colorful controllers. This, does just have like a special name to it, or is it just like pink? 'Cause it's pink, it's pink, we're calling it pink. And, we've got a blue and the purple. Dude, like these look so good, hi, beautiful. Look how good, especially this pink one, oh, no, no, no, no. They'll also have corresponding matching faceplates to go with all of the controllers. I do have the matching controllers to go to these, but they are actually back in Pennsylvania 'cause I had them shipped there. Those are now like my Pennsylvania controllers, when I'm back home visiting my family. That's like, I just seen problems right there. Oh, my east coast PlayStation controllers aren't here to show you how well they match with the face plates. Let's open up the controllers first. I need a knife, I need a knife, please hold. Look at this stuff, isn't it neat? Pink is so pretty, I definitely want to get a faceplate that matches. A huge thank you though, to Sony for sending me these to check out. I'm so, so excited. Oh, wow. The box looked nice, wow. Pink, no, look at this, oh my God, it's beautiful. Like this is something that I just wanna like set out and like display. The sheer, absolute beauty of this, oh my God, it's incredible, I love it. Oh, so this is like my sister's favorite color. I feel like the, okay, I mean, this is absolutely beautiful and it's stunning, but like, this is my sister's color and this is my color. It's so funny, 'cause like these are both of our exact favorite colors. And then in the middle of these, we've got the purple. It's hard to say like what my favorite color is. Like, I think pink and black are like my two favorite colors. I know black is a shade, it's not actually a color, but I'm not here to have a discussion about color theory. Purple used to be my favorite accent color. Some of you may remember if you've been around long enough, that I had a custom, Camo, a purple Camo PC. It was absolutely the coolest. Like this is the exact color of that PC too. Like, this is awesome. These are such good colors, freaking stunning, stunning. I can just sit here and admire them for, through all of the days. We've got the controllers unboxed and now we have the face plates. Feel like I'm just getting back into the video making process for the new year. I hope I'm even recording, we are. So I wonder how these go on. If it just snaps over top or do I have to like fully replace? That is the question. Directions, where's step one? Oh, okay. One, two and three are saying that I have to turn off the console. So like, yeah, I already did that. Remove the top cover by slightly pulling up on the direction of the arrow. All right, let's do it. Slightly pull it up. I'm scared. I'm so, I'm so scared right now. Dude, I'm stressing. This is terrifying, this is absolutely. Okay, that's already kind of out though. I'm so scared, I don't wanna break it. - [Male Speaker On Phone] You gonna put your hand behind it like this, put your fingers behind here (indistinct mumbling) at the same time, so let me show you. - Okay, it's actually a lot easier than I thought. Pull up and slide down at the same time. Wow, we did it. Is my microphone still on or did I knock it free? Yeah, so definitely those were, that's why it's slides. It's just like a little sliding mechanism. That's it, dude, freaking, what the hell? Look how good this looks. Oh, wow. Pull up, it slide. Okay, it's actually, it's pretty easy. I feel as though I have made it look a little more difficult than it is, but it's really not. Oh my God, this is so sleek. So good, check, check it, check it. Like, can you even? Oh, boy, this red also is so nice. It's almost like a, kind of like a pinkish color. It's not quite this pink. God, I'm so scared to put this back on. Pull up and slide, see? Yeah, totally simple. Oh, even, like, oh, this is like a real Marquez look. That'll come off. Just afraid of hurting my fingees, my little pingees. There we go, that's way easier after I've done it once or twice. This is beautiful, this is beautiful. Sony, you guys did a freaking great job. So I'd love to know from you guys, which color controller is your favorite? The original white one that came with the console? Do you prefer these super bright colors or do you prefer the Cosmic Red or the midnight and black? I actually had my little niece. She unboxed the two PlayStation controllers and man, she had like the best time ever. Show them, there you go, can you say cosmic? - Mic. - Red. (indistinct) Can you say black? - Back. - Can you say midnight night? - Night. - Can you say midnight black? - Night back. - Can you say PlayStation? (indistinct) She's now taking, taking them away, taking them to dad. Can you say bye? So excited to check this out. Again, a huge thank you to Sony for sending me these, that I can get a chance to show them to you. Wow, hyped about this pink. So lets just take one more quick little look at that. Just like, that's beautiful. Absolutely stunning. Well, thank you guys for watching, I'll see you in my next video. If there's anything that you'd like to see me cover here on my channel this year, leave it in the comments below. I also have brought back my Discord server. It's actually a joint server with my sister. It's called Same Brains, so I'll put a little link below. You guys can go check that out. And we've been having so much fun chatting over there. I just rebooted it like this past week, so we're still kind of like in the process. My hair keeps getting stuck in this middle of these loop, Apple watch fan. You may have seen it happen throughout this whole video. Stop it, stop it please. All right, I'm gonna go, see you later, bye.",
