    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine and today I'm doing a very quick unboxing for you, this is the BTS Samsung Galaxy S20 a 5G phone, this is such a beautiful phone, I cannot believe how amazing it is. This is the color that I had wanted them to launch initially when they first came out with this phone. In addition to the phone I also have the Galaxy BTS Buds as well, I was just reading about this phone, so the pre-orders went live and they sold out within an hour in South Korea, that's crazy. Samsung sent me this to check out, I do have to send it back, so unfortunately it is not mine to keep, but at least I get to show it to you guys. Also, before we get into this, I just want to say I'm thankful that Samsung came out with this phone, because for whatever reason I had never listened to BTS before, everyone in the entire world has been talking about how incredible they are, and for some reason I never listened, but I decided that if I was going to check out the phone I should probably take a listen to BTS, and I was absolutely blown away. The first time I had really listened to them was last week when my sister and I were doing our podcast, and I was telling her about this phone, and I thought I should probably do some research about BTS because I already know a lot about the Samsung S20 phone, (phone chime) What are you doing to me! LinkedIn, I have a LinkedIn notification? That's what I got interrupted for? Back to BTS, now, if you are a BTS fan you already know that they're incredible, but me, as a person who did not know, I now know, and I am so here for it. I don't want to say what any of my favorite songs are yet because I'm still learning, I'm still researching, you guys had sent me a bunch of videos that was like a crash course to learning about BTS, I'm so sorry, I wish that I knew more, but, all I have to say is I am here now, and I wish that I had found out sooner. Better late than never. Now let me show you this awesome phone. To reveal, those little hearts were actually right over the S20 logo. (upbeat music) I don't normally look at paperwork, but I think there might be some exciting BTS themed items in here. Oh yeah, we have stickers, so it has all of the band members names. It also has some little emoji icons here. I believe in your galaxy. So it comes with the stickers, what else is in here? So do you think that when I have to send this back to Samsung, that I'm sorry, I forgot to put the stickers in, oops, I forgot to put this, I forgot, shhh. Just kidding, I'll give them back. It's a very important part of this phone. (gasp) They look like little business cards, but they're for each band member. I would guess maybe you call them fan cards or something, I'm not really sure what the term would be. They also have a little heart on the back too, like a little holographic embossed heart. Don't mind my injury. All right, so here's the phone, this color is so beautiful it's like a hazy purple. And what I like about this is it's more of a matte finish, so a lot of phones tend to get smudgy when they have the glossy finish, but this is a really nice matte finish and it's kinda like an iridescent rainbowy color as well. Can you guys see that? (upbeat music) Oh and did we point out that there is a heart right here if you check by the cameras, I mean, it's so cute. Let's turn it on, I hope it's charged. Yes, it is! What else is in here? Is there anything in there? Oh we've go the standard ear buds, power charger, I believe in your galaxy, look! (chime) (gasp) I'm shook. Me being a new fan, I'm excited. I mean I've been a fan for what, a week and a half at this point, imagine being someone who is a huge fan of BTS, this would be, for me, being a really huge Tool fan, so if Tool came out with a custom Samsung phone, you better believe that I would be there in a second. I love it, I love the purple theme, this is like one of my favorite colors, so all the custom icons, everything. I absolutely love it. Let's check out the Galaxy Buds as well. Also a nice custom box. (gasp) whoa, this looks so great. And here's how they look next to each other, this also has a little heart over here at the front of it, so when you open it, you can see that. There's a lot of stuff in here. What's this? Looks like it's a smart buds cover, oh this is cool, you can wear this around your neck, or even like a key chain or something. Do we have more little cards? I think we might, I love it, so it has each one of them wearing the galaxy buds. (upbeat music) Are these more headphones? Oh, no, it's a charging cable, and some extra little tips for the ear buds. I feel like the only way to end this video, to make it just all come around full circle is to put the ear buds in, and listen to BTS. This is, well I'm actually watching a YouTube video, this is BTS's newest music video, that premiered over a week ago at this point, but this is \"Stay Gold\". I've listened to this one a few times. I can't let you guys hear what I'm listening to because it's copywritten, but these sound really good. I feel like I'm yelling, yeah, I'm maybe a little bit. (laughs) This is how I feel when I'm streaming games cause I have headphones on so I can't hear myself so I talk louder so that I can hear myself. It's beautifully shot music video, I'll put a link in the description. Although it has so many views that I feel like everyone in the world has already seen it. So here they are, I think they, I mean I don't know what they look like, I think they look good, I saw them on the band members and they look incredible. I also just love the purple, this is one of my favorite colors. I actually have a computer that is a purple camo, you guys might remember that I got a very long time ago. Even have the little logo on the buds and everything. Oh Bigsby wants an update. Okay. Do you guys have any suggestions for songs that I should listen to, videos to watch, anything at all, please leave them in the comments below or feel free to send me a tweet because I am currently doing a lot of BTS research. Thanks you guys for watching, and we also have a new podcast out so make sure you guys go check that out. I'll put all the links in the description, and if you guys enjoyed the video be sure to subscribe, hit the bell and I think that's all, I think that's everything that YouTube wants you to do. I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye! (electronic music)",
