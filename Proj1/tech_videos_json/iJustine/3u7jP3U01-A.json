    "transcript": "- Today, the Samsung Galaxy Z flip is released and we are going to the Samsung Experience Store, this is not sponsored by the way. I know it feels like it because I'm speaking sponsor-y. But I'm going to purchase the phone but our friend John actually already got the phone so I'm basically going to be paying him for the phone and then I'm going to take the phone from him. And I'm going to unbox it at the mall. Jenna, we're at the mall. - We're at the mall. We're going to see the Samsung experience. - Samsung experience. - It's gonna be a, we're in Glendale first off. - I'm excited because they have the mirror purple one and it looked so pretty at the Samsung event that we went to. There's also a Lego store here. That's why I come to Glendale. I come to Glendale to go to the dentist and go to the Lego store. - Are you sure, I thought we got the malls confused? - No, it's here. Trust me. It's here. (slow motion) Trust me. It's here. - I don't see it. Are we sure it's in the mall? - That's actually a really great question. (slow motion) Trust me. It's here. - I think it's outside. - Oh my god. Is it really? - I think it's on the other side. - Did I mess up? It's not here. At all. (phone navigation starts) I don't know. Hey, do you wanna be on Amazing Race? Absolutely not, I would get made fun of. Should we get back in the car? - But it's not that far. - Okay, it's not that far. We'll walk. - We'll walk, it's just right over there. We just need to walk around it. - You're right, you're right, you're right. (upbeat music) One hour free parking. Two hours free parking with, I could've got a car wash. I have really messed up. (upbeat music continues) - Okay, the deal's going down. - So, Best Buy evidently only had one purple and one black. Every store had two phones in it - Really? - We just got lucky. - That's incredible. - (clearing throat) Ain't nothing to see here. - (deepened voice) Yo, how am I gonna pay you? You want Apple Pay? You want Venmo? Like what do you do? - (higher pitch) I'll do a little uh apple pay. - Does telegram do paying? (laughs) I can write you a check? (music) We are here and we're gonna unbox. (singing) we are here and we're gonna unbox. - Did you already unbox it? (laughs) - Oh. Weird. Already did it. - Fast forward. Unboxed. - So we unboxed it for John's channel and now he was kind enough to reserve me a purple one. - Boom. - Thank you so much, I appreciate it. - My pleasure. - By the time I got home, they were all already reserved. - We have hit the goldmine on Best Buy. - This is the mirror purple and I don't have a knife. I don't wanna break their stylus. - Do you need help? Are you weak? - I almost always have a knife, but since I was traveling. - Yeah we made it all the way to Glendale today. (laughing) - Purple looks nice. - I mean, if you wanna use it, let me know. - Yeah, I'm, I feel good with my black purchase but. The purple's nice. - [All] (oohing) - Wow. - It's kinda got that aura glow. - It looks pink. - It does. It does look pink. - I wore pink today, because I don't really own a lot of pink. - This is beautiful. When using a wireless charger, fold the device and place the center of the device's back on the center of the wireless charger. - That actually good information. - Like that. Boom. - We've got some care instructions on the front. It says \"don't press the screen on the front camera lens with a hard, sharp object.\" Weird. I was planning on doing just that. \"When folding the device, do not place nay objects such as cards, coins or keys on the screen.\" - That's interesting. - That makes sense, I'm gonna leave my credit card in there. - Not waterproof or dust resistant. - There's no IP rating. - Don't attach any adhesives or films or stickers on the main screen. Your device also contains magnets, so keep a safe distance between your device and objects that may be affected by magnets. What if somebody has a pacemaker? Yeah, if you have a implantable medical device, consult your physician before use. Oh my goodness. This is very solid information. - Okay, good thing you read the instructions. You didn't read the instructions. - No, we didn't read the instructions. I mean I probably should have. - I'm sorry. - Maybe go back and read 'em. - Yeah, you should. - I'm helping. - [All] Oohh. (clapping) - Honestly, this is incredible. This color is so beautiful. It is like pink. It's beautiful. I was crushed, absolutely just heartbroken when I found out that the only pink color variant was in the S20, not the S20 Ultra. Like, I think S20 Ultra people want the pink. - Yeah, but now yours also flips. - It does. - I don't wanna touch it. - Yeah don't touch it. Don't smudge it up. - Just compare, look at that. Black's so much better. - Wow, I'm sorry, do you want this one? - No, I'm happy that you're enjoying it. - I'm so happy. - Oh my gosh, it's like high school, when everyone has the flip phone and I don't. I'm a loser. - Wait, you had a phone in high school? Did you have a phone in high school? - Yeah, uh no. No college when I got me phone, - Yeah same, college. We're a little bit older than Jenna. - I'm so young. - So, here it is. - It's so pretty. - USB-C, is this, does this have expandable storage? I don't think it does. - It does not. - Yeah okay, so no expandable storage. - 128 or 256? - I think it was 256, if I recall. - Yeah it's 256. - Alright, 256. - But the problem is, I love having like an SD card in my, at least, android phones, because I feel like transferring stuff, as a Mac user, sometimes can be a little bit difficult. But, I've been using the Linkshare. Have you used that? - I have. - It's great. - It's actually really handy. You also get 200,000 folds. But what we are wondering, is what constitutes a fold? Is this a fold? One, two. Or was that one? - I think that's one. - I think, well it's unfolding then folding, saying it out loud I guess that is just one. - Is it? - I think it's one. - Unfold and fold. - Unfold, fold. - Yeah because, you're not, yeah. I think that's one. - What do you guys think? Is the question. - So we have two, 12-megapixel cameras on the back. - Yeah. - And the front facing is a ten-megapixel - So it's wide and ultra wide on the back. An then it's ten on the front. It's actually the same camera system from the S10. - I like that the hinge is pretty stiff too, so you know if you do wanna get some cool time lapses. I would be careful when you set it down though, like you don't set it on any rocks or something. - That's true, or any of the things that could be hurt by magnets. - Yes, like a pacemaker. - So everyone's questions, I feel like is, what happens when you slam it, like when you're mad? - Do you wanna hear it? (mimics arguing on phone) I'm fighting. - Sorry we had to cancel your Postmates order. - What? - Oh, slow. - Not dramatic at all. - So this is my , this is how I'm flipping. I go like this. Hello. It's a nice hinge. - This is a nice hinge. - They seem very proud about the hinge. - Yeah there's like a little, like brush bristles in there to protect from particles getting into the hinge. But since it isn't dust resistant, I mean what does that actually mean then? - We need What's Inside to tell us what's inside the hinge. - We do. - So my legs are asleep again. - That's why I'm sitting like this. - I can't feel my knees. - Okay, I think we're done unboxing now, so I'm gonna continue on to whatever else is that we're gonna do today. - The set-up. - We're gonna go to The Cheesecake Factory because I want spaghetti. (music) - Got that compact. - Yes, CoverGirl claim. This is broken. - That is a beautiful color. - It is a beautiful color. (gradual music) - Thank you, oh my gosh it is so smudgy. - Gross. - So now we're going to do an exiting shot. We're gonna walk out. You ready? - Yeah. (upbeat music) - I'm making a video Jenna. Do something, perform. Wow. Look at that. Am I in the frame? - Yeah. You look good. Your arm is long. - I think I have the wide angle on. - Yeah do you want me to make it tighter? Closer? - Sure. - Ready? - How does the screen look? Does it look good? - Yeah. - Can you see the crease? - Depends on which angle you're looking at it from. Dead on, I don't see it. From the side I see it. - Oh no, I'm getting a phone call. On my other phone. - I think your trolley is about to take off. - We should probably move, their trolley's gonna hit us. Choo, choo. Okay, we're gonna take a selfie on the front facing. You double tap. Can you see it? - Oh yeah. - Yeah, see. I just took a picture. Okay, let's see if we can get the trolley in the back. We can. It's there. Ready? (very upbeat music) These are so good. - Yeah I don't know if it's that good. - This is good content. (very music continues) Okay, recording now on the front facing camera. Doing a little test here, hi Jenna. - Hello. - We're gonna go to the cheesecake factory, we were gonna go home but I'm really hungry and I don't think that I can wait that long in traffic before we eat food. Is that live music? I don't think it's live, I think it's recorded. (upbeat music) - You can also go around. - It's fine, it's fine. Go around. - Gosh my patience today. Oh there's a food option. - I'm not food. - You're not food. Although you looking like a snack. (upbeat music) - The Galaxy Z Flip has a 6.7inch, AMOLED display, this top little cover is a 1.1inch AMOLED display. This can be used for notifications and also taking front facing selfies. Front facing selfie camera is 10 megapixels. The rear cameras, there's two: there's a 12 megapixel ultra wide camera, and a 12 megapixel wide angle camera. It shoots up to 4K UHD at 60 frames a second. It does have wireless and fast charging. It also has wireless powershare. It's equipped with 8GB of RAM, 256GB of internal storage. The power button also acts as a fingerprint sensor. All with a 2.95GHz 64 Bit optical processor. And it'll only cost you about $1400, but, oh my God. That was my biggest fear, is that I was going to flip it and I was going to accidentally throw it. Good thing I'm in a confined space. Let's try that again. All for just $1400. Hello. The flip is satisfying. It closes and Tyler doesn't think the close is satisfying. - It's satisfying, but for me personally... - For him personally. - ...its not satisfying enough. - Is he wants it to kind of auto close, which I get it but the reason that I like this is because you can basically make this stay, however you want, like its okay. Well see that closed a little bit by itself. - (sighs) yeah. - Yeah. So we are back from our fun little afternoon getting the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. So far this thing is pretty cool, I haven't really got a chance to fully use it as an actual phone yet because I haven't got a SIM card activated. So that is also on my to do list before this evening is over, and I have until nine o'clock. But honestly, first impressions is, this is cool. Obviously I'm a huge Apple fan and I always love having my iPhone because it does what I need it to do and it works in my Apple ecosystem. But I always have a second device that is an Android phone. So right now, this is gonna be it. The question that I'm asking myself, am I going to want to stick with this, instead of getting the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra? That's the real question. Because this honestly is really, its pretty cool. It does feel kind of novelty and it's really funny because when you're walking around with it. And we were making a video earlier, a lot of people kept stopping us on the street and we wondering, what is that? One of the thing that I like is apps will transform depending upon if this phone is folded or not folded. So when we fold it, you'll notice that it moves itself up to the top. And we're going to take a selfie, so hold on a second here. What are you focusing on, me? Oh, we're taking another. I can't wait to try out some time lapses with this thing. It really does look like a compact. Like there's no way around that, it really does. Do you wanna get the selfie front facing little camera here? Then if I want to take a picture, I just press. It used the timer. (laughs) And now we open, it will automatically open the camera app and there's the picture we just took. - I look like a Gremlin. - Yeah you do a little bit. It's a little Gremlin-esque. I look forward to testing this out more. I'm just a little worried because I've been flipping this so much already, that I'm probably at least at 20,000 flips for the day. That's a lot. I can't even realistically think of how many times I've open and closed it. But again, the question that we were asking ourselves, what is a fold? Is this a fold? One. Or, is this a fold? One. One, two. Or one. Leave us your comments below. Thank you guys for watching. Be sure to subscribe and like this video if you enjoyed it. I'll be doing some further testing with this. Make sure you go check out my sister's channel. She made a little vlog as well from our day, so go check that out. She also has a few other videos, talking about some of the new Samsung phones and of course she has lots of other fun videos as well. So I will see you guys in my next video. I'm going to be traveling here very shortly, so I'll be taking this with me and filming some videos with it. So, let me know if there's anything you'd like to see. It's dreamy. I'll see you guys in my next video. Bye. (upbeat music)",
