    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going? It's Justine and this is my sister Jenna - Hello. - And today we are unboxing something really, really really really really really exciting. (upbeat music) I bought this at best buy, I did a video for them not too long ago and I wanted to dedicate a full unboxing to this coffeemaker, we love Keurig. - Oh my gosh, so I mean I've been using the Keurig basically my entire life. - Her entire life. - My entire coffee drinking life. I started in college, which is a long time ago. So yeah, this is my life. - This is not only a coffee maker because we have had several Keurig but different variations and then we also have the iced coffee maker one. - Yes. - We have the small little tiny one cup ones, but this is a latte maker. - Oh. - You could make a latte. - This is a special edition. Did you know? - Oh, what's the special? - Okay, you can do four cup sizes. You can do strong brew. You can do coffee shot for specialty drink. Dishwasher safe. - That's what I like. - Coffee lattes, cappuccinos. - Okay, lets open. - Yes, please. Oh, enjoy, 50% off. - Oh, look at this. - Wait did they give you a cup. Oh, the... - It's for the milk, the frothing. - I'm new to this. - Let's get in here, this is so, - Let's take it out of the box - Huge. - Oh, wow. - It's beautiful. - Oh, this is a nice nickel. - I was so excited when I saw this the best buy. I freaked out. - You went to best buy without me. I did, I'm sorry. I shot a whole video there without you. - You're a monster. - Tyler was there. - You're a monster. - Okay, so let's take these little stickies off. - Yeah, that's my favorite part. Well no, my favorite part is the coffee. - But we haven't got there yet. Have you guys heard the song that goes, Jenna, do you - Feel like I do - I always forget the lyrics - Jenna. Jenna, do you feel like I do, Jenna. Jenna do you feel like I do - That's how I prefer it. - Aren't the directions somewhere. Do we need the directions? We probably need the directions. - Lets get, brewing. - [Man] You have more stickers. - Where - We do, where. - That's my bad. - There's a lot happening, get out of there. This is not sponsored by Keurig by the way. at all, in any shape or form. - Let's get brewing. - Okay. Remove the packaging, remove the plastic, okay, plug it into a grounded outlet. - Okay. - [Justin] What does that mean? - [Jenna] I don't know how big 12 ounces this is, but. - What, that's not gonna fit. Wait we need to move this. That's perfect actually just so you know for future reference, that's not 12 ounces. - [Jenna] Well, I was doing it for shock. God, have we never seen a YouTube video before. I have the room mug. Press the power button, the power light and auto off light will illuminate. - It's illuminating, everything's illuminating. - The brew will automatically begin heating the water. This will take about three minutes. Once the heating stops. The Brewer, is ready. - Got our coffee here. I also got this at best buy too, can you believe it? - Oh! I bought a fridge at best buy, I bought my washer and dryer at best buy. I will never forget the guy was like, Well what kind of washer and dryer to me do you need. Do you need a dryer that hooks up to gas or electric? And I looked at him and I said, sir, I absolutely.(mumbles) - That's a big mug. This is really hot. We don't know how much brew to put in. - One second, probably like four ounces. - Whoa. - Read all instructions. - Okay, we're gonna make, a latte. Number one, to make a hot latte or hot cappuccino tip having trouble frothing. - There's buttons - There's a phone number to call them. I'm gonna call them so call them really quickly. I just need to ask. I don't, I just need to ask to make sure. - I'm not gonna be part of this. - [Keurig Customer Care]This is Zayn and how may I assist you. - Yes, I just got a latte maker and I was just curious, Is there a difference if I use a different type of milk. Like an oat milk. - [Keurig Customer Care]I'm, yes ma'am we have a different quality, the effect of the frother it will froth the milk, but it might just take a little bit longer in order to do so. - Okay, great. I was just about to try it. So I just wanted to call and make sure before I started. - [Keurig Customer Care]Do you have any thing else I can try to answer for you? - That's it. Thank you so much, I appreciate it. You're very helpful. - Thank you. - [Keurig Customer care]Have a great day. Thank you for calling Keurig. - You too, Bye. - He was so nice. - Okay, step one. Place mug and pod. Put this in. So we're gonna make a latte, so fill this up into the latte line, Jenna. - Yes. - [Jenna] Oh gosh - [Justine] Oh gosh. You're spilling the milk. - No, I didn't spill any of the milk. - You're filling the ounce. 'Cause I'm gonna put this down. I have to add water. - Wait, that's a lot of milk, is this way I get stomach aches when I have lattes. - Yeah, lattes, I have a lot of milk. - Self realization, I'm calling the self help. - Latte cappuccino, I have pushed. - Do you think we should use a clear mug so they can see. Do you have a clear coffee mug? Sorry. - I think that's like a for whiskey. - Is that for whiskey - Oh, oh, it's already going. We did it, how's the milk going. - It looks od. - Oh no. - Oh no. - We forgot to push that button. - Oh my gosh, it's spinning - Holy crap! - Oh my goodness. - This might be the best thing I've ever seen in my life. Let me give you guys a little picture view of it over here. - Picture a picture of you, sometimes called a video. picture view. - It's spinning. Oh. Oh, my goodness. Look at that. - Oh my God! - Oh no. - It's done, It's ready. - I should give it a little more because my friend says so. - it's really upsetting you. - Yeah, I think it is upset with me because it knew that - It's like flashing all the buttons - Yeah, I think it's ready. Okay, are you ready for this, get freaking hyped. Oh! (upbeat music) Look, I'm gonna make you some art Okay, I didn't do a very good job of it but I'll practice, have you seen anything so beautiful before - I'm gonna smell it . - Yeah give it a smell. - Picture this a little cinnamon. - Oh yes. (upbeat music) - That's a lot of... - Oh no. - That's a lot of cinnamon. Can I taste, oh - Let's get this an icing next. Oh my gosh I'm opening up a coffee shop today. - What should we call our coffee shop? - We'll call it... - Justine and Jenna's juice. - Juice - Mmh - [Jenna] Hot - It's really hot. Oh my gosh. - Oh my God - Oh my goodness - Here I am, imagining. - That little bit of cinnamon. I'm shaking. - Mmh! - Right. - It's lovely. Oh to my goodness - Oh my goodness. So the reason that I picked this is. Is something that I wish that I would have had when I was in college, is because honestly I spent so much money at Starbucks and this actually would have saved me so much money I wish that I would have had this I know but why didn't I get one. - I don't know - I know 'cause, - Not long ago. - I know 'cause I always spent so much more money. I'd go to Starbucks and get like a latte for like four or five bucks but I could have made my own. - What tips do you have for them, like if they're just going to college for the first time 'cause Jenna actually has a forensic biology degree. Which is kind of crazy. - I would say that, don't wait into the last minute. You think procrastination is your friend. It is not, don't wait until the last minute. I wish I would have been better at planning, other than a coffee maker. I definitely wish that I would have worked into like fitness - Into my college routine because it is something that when you go to college, it's like, oh my gosh, I'm away from home. I'm going to eat all of the snacks and all of the treats and I'm going to just watch TV and play video games. And sort of do my work. Try to work on it no matter what. - And just try to eat healthy, Yeah, the freshman 15 it got me. It was a real thing. - I think I have a little more then - I may have as well, but yeah, it's a real thing. - It's a real thing. So yeah, this was great. - It was really good. Cheers, you don't, hear it, well. - Oh, enjoy it. - Yeah, well, that's it. We'll see you guys in the next video. Make sure you check out Jenna's channel.
