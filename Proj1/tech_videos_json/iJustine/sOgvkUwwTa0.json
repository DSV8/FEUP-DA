    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going, it's Justine and today we're going to be unboxing the brand new OnePlus 6. This was just officially announced in London and guess what? We've got one early to check out. I'm really excited about this phone. If you guys know me, there's a few things that I love in life, and phones and drones are up there at the top with food and video games, sleeping. Let's stop talking and let's unbox. (cardboard ripping) Looks like the first thing we've got is a reviewer's guide! Wow, that's a lot of cases, guys, this is really excessive. Phone, one case, two case, three case, four case, five cases, wow. I have more cases than I have t-shirts in my closet now. Let's go. (upbeat music) - Time for the big reveal! I wonder what color it's gonna be. Spoiler alert: it's the mirror black. This comes in three different colors. There's the midnight black, the mirror black, and the silk white. That silk white, it should just have my name on it. All white, and has rose gold accents. Oh man, check it out! I never want to smudge up a brand new phone because this looks so shiny and perfect and beautiful. But let's do it anyway. Oh my gosh guys, this looks really nice. One of the things that you will notice is this does have an all glass black, an all glass front, and it looks really slick. Man, this looks awesome, the dual camera, the fingerprint sensor ... I love this center camera! There's just something so satisfying about pulling off the plastic fronts and backs of things. (upbeat music) - With this all new glass back and front, OnePlus managed to work with the glass differently. So it feels more like ceramic, but it's not as heavy or fragile. And since it is all glass, you'll have much better transmission with up to one gigabyte of download speed. Which, is great, so I can watch more Netflix and YouTube. It's got a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, a 6.28-inch full object AMOLED Display, running OxygenOS. And with fast-charge, a half hour will give it enough power for the entire day. Should we see what else is in the box before we turn it on? I'm not gonna lie, this is probably one of my favorite things about OnePlus, is the USB cable. I carry this USB-C cable around everywhere because it looks so cool and everyone is always giving me compliments on it. Look at this, do you guys see that? I absolutely love OnePlus's attention to detail, even inside of this USB charging brick, it's red. The USB cable is beautiful, the box, everything. It's just, it's fantastic. Let's see what other kind of goodies are in here. Another case! Like even the box, like look at this! It's so thoughtful, they put little cushions there. SIM card ejector, super important! Paperwork has a nice little home, how cute. Alright, let's turn this thing on. Dual SIM cards, that's the way to my heart. So one of the first steps is to set up our face data. So let's try face unlock, let's add my face. I can now use my face to unlock my phone. One of the things that drives me really crazy about some phones is that they install so much excessive software. It's completely unnecessary and I feel like it just bulks your phone down. And then there's like all these apps and stuff that you don't need so this is very simple. It's basically what you need, nothing more. OK, so what should I do first? I'm not even sure. I love the dual camera, I'm so excited to go out and take some photos. Take a picture of you guys, oh you look great. OK guys, smile, let's take a selfie, are you ready? OK you gotta look really good, are you smiling? Some of you guys blinked. (upbeat music) - I'm very excited to try out the video on this, it does 4K, 60 frames a second, and it also has a new slow-mo mode so you can shoot 480 frames a second. This also has a built in video editor which I think is very exciting because I feel like a lot of the other apps that I've downloaded before to edit video just don't quite cut it. I feel like they did a pretty good job of the notch as well, there is gonna be something later on in the software update where you can make this entire black bar up here completely solid. But right now, as you can see, there's the notch. Get you all cleaned up. So let's try on some of the cases and see what they look like on the new phone. I really, I just honestly can't get over how much I love having the centered camera. Everything just looks very symmetrical. So this is the case that came with it, it is a very very simple, very sleek, it's kind of like a dark gray, transparent little case. So this next one is a carbon fiber, (cardboard ripping) this one looks so good, well I think I officially found my favorite one, I haven't even opened up any of the other ones yet, but this carbon fiber looks really slick. I'm gonna check out the other ones but I already found my favorite. (cardboard tearing) - Oh man! I thought that I liked this one but I really like this one too! And it has this soft little inside. Here's the good news, my phone can have an outfit for every day. This one's little bit thicker because it does come up a little bit over the sides which I do like because it will protect the front of your screen just a little bit from drops. Here's another black case, this one is called Sandstone Protective Case. (cardboard tearing) - Just when I thought that I had my favorite I will say that this is probably my least favorite. This is the Ebony Wood Bumper Case. Not really a fan of wood paneling on anything, so obviously I'm not gonna be a fan of it on my phone. (cardboard tearing) - Actually, it looks almost exactly like my hardwood floor. OK, I'm pleasantly surprised because I thought I wasn't gonna like this at all. It's definitely not a top pick, but it actually looks really really good. (cardboard tearing) So this is the red Silicone Case, I like that the logo is just kind of embossed into the silicone. Every single time that I think, I don't think I'm gonna be that into this case, I am shockingly surprised. This one also looks really good. I will say that I think my final decision for what I'm gonna go with moving forward, at least currently, is this one, this is the black Sandstone. I love it because the logo is subtle, it's a nice low-profile case. Well, thank you guys so much for watching this unboxing, I hope you guys enjoyed this. I'll put a link in the description if you wanna check out more information about the new OnePlus 6. A huge thank you to the OnePlus team for sending me one early to check out. This is so incredible and I cannot wait to get further into this and do some photo tests and video tests. But for now I will see you guys in my next video, if you guys enjoyed this video or if you like these types of things, be sure to hit the subscribe button and also hit the bell so you'll be notified when I post new videos. And I will see you guys in my next video. (upbeat music)",
