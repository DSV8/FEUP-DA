    "transcript": "- Hey guys! How's it going? This is gonna be a very quick video, but this has been a very highly requested question that I get all the time. Not only do I get this question online, but I get it in actual real life out in the wild. That question is, \"Where did you get your backpack?\" I've been using this backpack for almost a year now, and I am obsessed with it. Now, not only do I have this backpack, but I have another one as well. These two I've pretty much had in rotation over the past two years. They're by Loungefly. This is not sponsored. Ed actually bought me this one for my birthday last year, and then shortly after, I got this one because I loved this one so much. This one has cartoon baby Star Wars characters on it. And of course, this one has a beautiful Stormtrooper pattern on it. I'm obsessed. And I'm making this video mostly because people have been asking me so much where I get them. One of the things that I've been struggling with for a very long time is trying to find the perfect mini backpack. One that I can fit all of my items in and it not be too big but not be too small. This is the perfect size. One thing that I do wish that it had was some sort of a pocket inside. 'Cause right now you've only got two pockets. You've got this big one and then this small one. And because I'm paranoid, I don't like to put my wallet inside here because someone could easily just open that up if you're walking and take it right out. So I like to have that hidden inside. So if there was an inside zipper part, that would be so incredible. 'Cause then I wouldn't have to be paranoid. I mean right now all someone's gonna steal is ChapStick if they get in here. So because I've been using these for the past year, I wanted to see if they had any more. And guess what? They have so many! This company, I feel like, has bought the rights to pretty much everything. Marvel, Pokemon. If there's something that you're into, they probably have it. Not only do they have backpacks, they have tiny little purses and clutches. They have so many things, it's kind of overwhelming. But for me, I'm a backpack fan, and I gotta show you guys the two new ones that I just got. (object clatters) Oh, that wasn't the best reveal ever, but here they are! This one specifically, when I saw this I started freaking out. This one has to be fairly new because I never saw it, and I have been searching probably the past year just for something else that I liked as much as I like these two. I really like this one, this is the Darth Vader backpack, because it's all black, and it pretty much matches anything. But unless I'm wearing Rebel Alliance gear, I don't really think I'm gonna be matching this much. 'Cause this color scheme is way easier to match. I mean clearly if I'm wearing Star Wars backpacks, I'm not really that concerned with if things are matching or not. But either way, you guys are probably gonna see these in Instagram, you're gonna see them on Twitter. And now you'll know, if someone Googles, \"Where did Justine get her backpack?\" this video will show up, and it will have all the answers and all of the links in the description. Again, not sponsored. But honestly you guys have been asking so much and I feel like these are so perfect for all of you. I love the new Pokemon one that they have. It's black like this but it has little Pokeballs all over it. I had to draw the line somewhere (laughs). So after these two, and I feel like I'm set for quite a while. So let me know what you guys think. Do you guys have a favorite? I'm not really sure which one I like the best because I feel like all of these are so different, it really depends on what my outfit is. I wonder if they have a BB-8 one. Wait a minute. Is this a mini backpack? They do have a BB-8 mini school backpack as well, but I don't think it's as small as this one is, though. I don't need it. I don't need it. I don't need it. You don't need it! You don't need it! Well thank you guys so much for watching! I will see you in my next video. Let me know what you guys think of these backpacks. Do you already have one? Do you have any other Loungefly products? If so, let me know in the comments below, and I'm so sorry if you're gonna go shopping now. But don't worry. It's worth it! (playful music)",
