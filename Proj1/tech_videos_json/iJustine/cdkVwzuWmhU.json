    "transcript": "- Hey guys, how's it going? So right now, we are heading into PetSmart with our dog, Matty. Jenna, behind the camera. - [Jenna] Hello! - We're currently on the East Coast. We've been visiting our family a lot this year. So, we decided that it'd be really fun to do an East Coast cribs make-over for Matty. So, a huge thank you to PetSmart for sponsoring this video. This is actually our one-stop go-to for all of our pets needs. So thank you guys so much for supporting our channel and our baby boy, Matty. He is crying in the car because he wants out. He wants to go shop. You ready to go shopping, buddy? Come on. Let's go. Do you want a drink before we shop? No. - [Jenna] He's like no lets go shopping. - [Justine] Okay. (upbeat music) - So one of the really cool things about PetSmart is they also have PetSmart charities and through their adoption programs, if you don't have a pet, they can also help you adopt one. Matty, maybe we adopt another pet today? (upbeat music continues) - Okay Matty first thing we're gonna find, we're gonna find you a bed. Okay? Let's go get you a bed. Look at all these options. Hey, check this out. This one's a little high for you, but look. Ooh, is that a soft little bed? First item, success. The one thing that I think he also needs is a crate. We have one at home and he was crate trained when he was little, so now it's like his little comfort zone. See if this one is gone for you, look at this. This is a 30 inch folding crate. It's by Top Paw, can you say Top Paw? I think it should be good size. Come here buddy. You know what else we need, Matty? We need to find a crate pad. What do you think of this mat? Do you think this is nice? (upbeat music continues) - [Justine] We've got to find something to store your treats and your food in. This is so cute. He's a very small dog. I feel like we could actually use this, though. To put his toys in. So if you have a bigger dog, this would be perfect to store their food in. This one is actually also really cute. This is much smaller. And my sister also has a dog, so we can put all of their treats in here. Time to find you a food and water bowl, okay? Let's see this one. Test it out. Eat. Good boy. I've also been wanting to get a little dog camera for him so that we can watch him when we aren't home. Check this out, buddy. 1080 full HD. Oh, it's actually wire free, which is awesome. IP 65 weather resistant. What's cool about this is if you do have a dog that is outdoor, this is weather resistant. So you'll be able to put it outside, check that out. But this also works for indoor as well. Into the cart you go. (upbeat music continues) - [Justine] So, since he already has this harness, let's get him a collar and a leash. Okay. I absolutely love this one. Yeah. And they have the matching leash. - [Jenna] That's nice. - [Justine] That is so nice. We need a little grooming accessories. Might need to use this for myself. (upbeat music continues) - Oh man. Okay. So, this is actually not for Matty. This is for my sister's dog, Bo. Matty only likes toy balls when another dog is playing with it and both of them are going to lose their minds when they see this. (upbeat electronic music) - [Justine] We did it. We did it. Now it's time to go home and set up your new crib. (electronic music continues) - Look at you in your little bed. Come here, I'm going to scoop you up like a burrito. There we go. This collar looks so nice on you. Do you say thank you, PetSmart? Did you know that PetSmart also has curbside pickup and you can get things same day on DoorDash? Did you know? Now you do. Time to set up. He said, can you put some food in that bowl? (whispering) Oh, what's that? Is that yours? Is that your toy? (electronic music continues) I love how these just fold down. So look, you can really take this anywhere. Oh, this has two sides. We can decide which way he wants his entryway door. This is what you use for crate training. So when they're a baby, you don't want them to have too much room to move around or potty. So you can use this divider to crate it off as they get older. Matty's a big boy now so he doesn't need a divider. Come here top dog, top paw. I gotta put this in there, buddy. I know you like it so much. Can I put this in there? And then you can go in there. - [Jenna] Matty you gonna go to your crate? - [Justine] Come here. There you go. Good boy. We trained him when he was little. Clearly, he hasn't forgotten. I mean, would you forget something for a treat? No. Eat bowl. His little drink bowl here. Jenna actually had a really good idea for this. Obviously, this is too large to use for food for our dog, but for a larger dog, this would be incredible for dry food. But we're going to use this as your little toy box. I put all your toys in there. This is already looking great. (calm, upbeat music) - Now it's time to check out the outdoor camera, which, we're going to be using it indoors. (calm music continues) - Bo, look, we got this for you. Get it! Get it, get it, get it, get it! Another one! Oh, so many. Okay. These are actually perfect juggling balls. (energetic music) Well, it seems like Bo is also enjoying his new toys. Thank you guys for watching, I hope you guys enjoyed this video, I'll put a link in the description, if you want to check out all of the items that I bought for Matty from PetSmart. Thank you again, PetSmart, for sponsoring this video and a huge thank you to Matty for being a good sport and Bowie. You also benefited from the shopping spree. If you guys haven't already be sure to hit subscribe and like this video, if you enjoyed it and leave a comment below for me to read to Matty. Oh my gosh. He also loves his new bed, too. This is awesome. I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye! (energetic outro music)",
