    "transcript": "- Hey guys, it's Justine. And today, we're checking out the brand new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip4. I am so excited about this. I've told you I think every single year that the new iteration of this phone that has come out that it is my absolute favorite device. Yes, I know. I'm iJustine. I love Apple. I love iPhones. But as for Android, there is just something about this device that is just so appealing. It's so beautiful. It's so small. It's so compact. And just this flip, I just can't get enough of it. It's goals. So I've been testing this out for the past week. And one of my favorite things is how seamless this hinge feels. Now, that doesn't feel like there's a huge upgrade from the previous version. But I can definitely tell a difference. Also, the hinge is now a little bit more flat as opposed to rounded, so it does kind of feel like it's a little bit smaller. Also, as you guys know, when I do my reviews, I'm coming at this from a content creator's perspective. I'm someone who is always filming videos. I'm always taking photos. I'm posting things on social media. And this is honestly such an incredible device for doing all of those things. Now, the cameras on this are by no means the highest rated cameras that are out on the market. But one of the things that I do love about this is the ease of use of this device, because you can just kind of place it anywhere and take photos and instantly start filming. The video quality, the photos, they all look really, really good. So even if you are getting this to create content, and you're a little bit worried about, (gasping) they're not the best cameras on the market. How will I ever survive? You're gonna be okay. We can get through this together. Let's go take some photos. So satisfying. So what's new with the new Galaxy Z Flip? Well, it has a new slimmer hinge, a larger 3,700 milliamphour battery. And you can quick charge it up to 50% in 30 minutes. It also has Wireless PowerShare, which is pretty cool if you need to share some battery with a friend. The 6.7 inch display has 120 Hertz adaptable refresh rate. It's also 45% stronger with a new Ultra Thin Glass. It features a Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 processor. It's IPX8 water resistance. It has an upgraded main camera that is 65% brighter and improved stabilization and tracking. This has eight gigs of RAM, and you can configure the storage from 128 up to 512 gigs. The starting price is 999. And it comes in this color, which is Bora Purple, Graphite. And there's two new colors: Pink Gold and Blue. You'll also be able to further customize up to 75 different color accommodations with their Bespoke Editions. (upbeat music) So there are three cameras on this. There is a front-facing camera and the two here on the back. Now, the two in the back, there's a wide and an ultra wide, and those are both 12 megapixels. And the one thing that is missing from this device is a telephoto lens. I do wish that there was a telephoto. But of course, you do have some optical zoom, so it'll kind of make up for it. But there really is no replacing that third lens that will give you that telephoto look. Now, the front-facing is a 10 megapixel selfie camera which will also shoot 4K 30. And the rear facing cameras will allow you to shoot 4K 30 and 60 frames a second, which is pretty exciting. This does have an improved battery life over the previous version. So this now is a 3,700 milliamphour battery. And because this is also running the Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen processor, those two things together should improve our battery life significantly. So I'm excited to keep testing this out and to see how the battery life is holding up. So far, so good. This is the front cover display. And it's so cool to see how far we've come since the first version, because this is actually a functional display now. So we have access to all sorts of things. We have all kinds of widgets that we can add on here. You can get your notifications that pop up. And you can even use this to take photos. You can double tap, and this will give you the full view, so you can see everything. You can see the full image. And you can take that photo by just tapping. You can also do video if you keep scrolling. I love that on the new Flip4, it has a Gorilla Glass backed. And this is matte. This is not shiny like the previous versions. So this alleviates a lot of those issues that we used to have with fingerprints. And it's also beautiful. One of the features that I like is Flex Mode. So it's basically turning your phone into like a little, tiny mini laptop. So when you go like this, and you fold it, a lot of the apps are now optimized to take advantage of this fold. So for example, take Instagram here. When I fold it, it automatically moves my video portion up there, and I have all of my controls down here on the bottom. So I can make my video. I can add music. I can add filters. All like a tiny little, mini laptop. Okay, I'm gonna do an Instagram Live. Now, this is great, because I can basically just set this here. I am now live. It's like you guys are helping us make a video right now. This freaking flip is just so cool. And it's technically a fold, but it's folding it in half the other way. What camera setup are you using? This is A74. Oh, my God. Okay. So kblack bought three badges, so now they profile photo will glow. Shut up. I will see you guys, I guess, in the next one. Jake says bye. We're gonna continue on our way. So now it's time to test out the video. And one of the things that I like is, when I'm filming myself with the back cameras, I can't ever actually see myself. But with this, I can turn on the cover screen preview. So I can turn the cover screen preview on, and I will be able to use the front-facing. So with this, I'm able to film myself, and I'm able to actually see if I'm in a frame. I'm speechless. Like, this is so great, 'cause you're gonna be able to actually film using the high quality cameras. And you'll be able to see if you're in frame. Are you in frame? Yep. Am I in frame? Yep. (upbeat music) So now this is the Super Steady Mode, so we're gonna see how steady is. Okay, ready? Let's go for a little run. (upbeat music) So now we're testing out the front-facing camera. How's it look? How does it sound here? Here it is. Here it is. There's Jake. Hello. There's a dog. Oh, there's so many dogies. Oh, so cute. So cute. Thank you guys so much for watching. I had so much fun getting a chance to check out the Flip. I'm so excited to also do a video on the Fold. But I really wanted to do this one first, because this is still my favorite form factor. As I've said before, I absolutely love this phone. I love this device. And I'm so excited to see all of the future iterations of Flips and Folds by Samsung. Samsung has been doing a really great job at pushing the envelope and really creating a whole entire market based around these foldable devices. So I am a hundred percent here for it. Oh, that's so satisfying. (phone folding) If you guys are new here and haven't already, please subscribe to my channel and also hit the bell, so you'll be notified when I post new videos. Tech season is going to be here before you know it. It's basically, actually, let me check my calendar. Yep. It's here. Stay tuned for more fun videos. I look forward to seeing you guys in the next one. Bye. (upbeat music)",
