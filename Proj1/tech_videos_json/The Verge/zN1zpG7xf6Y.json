    "transcript": "- Hey, it's Chris Welch with the Verge here at IFA 2019, and this is LG's G8x ThinQ. (ambient beats) It's a phone with a case that acts as a second screen. We've heard a lot about foldable phones from Samsung, Huawei, that's the trend of the future it seems. But LG thinks this is a more productive, smarter approach. When you don't need that second screen anymore, you just take the phone out and go about your day. Okay, so the big story is obviously that second screen. But the G8x ThinQ is like an upgraded version of this year's G8. It's got the same Snapdragon 855 processor, 128 GB of storage and 6 GB of RAM. There's FastCharge 4.0, wireless charging, the usual HiFi deck for high quality audio, and there's and in-display fingerprint sensor since that case is gonna cover up the back. And then there are the cameras. This is a company that's always been known for it's cameras, and on back you get a 12-MP standard camera, a 13-MP super wide angle camera, and there's the 32-MP front facing camera. Now, by default, those images come out at 8-MP but if you want, you can bump it up to 32. There are new camera modes, too. There's something called 'AI action shot' if you have fast-moving subjects. The Steady Cam for video shooting has gotten much better, so says LG. And by far, the weirdest new camera trick is ASMR-mode where the microphone records at three-times higher sensitivity so you can be really quiet, talk very quietly and make whatever weird YouTube videos you want. (ambient beats with piano) So both the phone and the second screen have a 6.4-inch full HD-Plus display. There's a notch, and the second screen also has a notch, because LG wanted symmetry. Seems bizarre to me but that's what they decided. There is a headphone jack on bottom, so that's still here with LG's usual Hi-Fi deck. There are dual stereo speakers. On the bottom is USB-C and you have your Google Assistant button on the side still as well, plus power and volume. So that rounds out the hardware on the phone. It's a nice refinement of the G8 from earlier this year, but now let's talk about that second screen. So, using the second screen couldn't be much easier. You just pop the phone in and it connects over USB-C. You pull down your quick settings and then you activate Dual-Screen, and viola! So when you have two screens, one obvious use case is the camera. You can hand the phone to somebody, and when they take your photo you can see the composition on the other screen to make sure everything looks right. And, you look beautiful. So, you can obviously watch a video on one screen, and browse the web on the other, but if you're playing videos or playing a game on one screen and a video on the other, you can actually control the volume for each one and listen to two things at the same time. So on the front of the phone is this little tiny OLED display that shows the time, battery level, notifications, things like that. It's not really a third screen but it's nice to have. One bad thing is that it doesn't get very bright at all. So that's the G8x ThinQ. This is LG's idea for what the future of phones might be, and there are other ideas like foldable phones. What you want depends on what you need from a phone and what you want to do with it. It's going to be coming out in the coming weeks and the hope is that most carriers will bundle the second screen with the phone at no extra cost. Thanks for watching! What's your idea for what the future of phones should be? Should they fold? Should there be a second screen in a case? Let us know and stay tuned for all of our coverage here at IFA 2019.",
