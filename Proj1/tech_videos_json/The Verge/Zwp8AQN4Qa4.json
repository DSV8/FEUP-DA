    "transcript": "Looks like Elon might actually be buying Twitter, after all. Any advice? Do you think Twitter's going to be better off? I mean this has been such a wild saga. I'm really curious what you make of it. I don't know. I think this is another one of these things that it's really unclear how it'll actually turn out. So you know obviously, it's it's out there and I think it's interesting as a saga like you're saying but but I think even at this point it's not actually clear what's going to happen.",
