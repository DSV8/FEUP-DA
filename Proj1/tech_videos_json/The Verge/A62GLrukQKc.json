    "transcript": "These are Apple's new second generation AirPods Pro and I really wanted to know, are there mics as good as the OG wired Apple headphones that to this day have the very best mic in a headphone. You see, many headphones such as Google's Pixel Buds Pro or Nothing Ear 1's or even Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 Pro that have a very long name all claim to have great mics but even the Sony link buds that I thought had great mics came nowhere near the mic quality you could get from this mic on these here wire Apple headphones. So how about the new second gen AirPods Pro? Do we finally have a new mic test winner? I don't think we do but let me know down below.",
