    "transcript": "This TV remote didn't use batteries and had no electrical parts. It's the Zenith Space Command, originally from 1956, and it used ultrasonic sound to control the television. If you look inside the 70s version of the remote, you'll see four different length rods. These act as tuning forks, which ring out in an audible high-pitch frequency when you press a button. Zenith had microphones built into their televisions that would pick up these frequencies and activate a circuit to control the set. All you had to do was press a button in the same room as the TV, you didn't need an IR blaster or electronics. This was purely a mechanical device. It did have its flaws. People found that jingling keys or coins could be picked up by the TV's microphones. And the high-pitch frequencies from the remote were discernible by pets. But look at these buttons. They stand tall and stiff, there's no room for error. The Space Command buttons are slow and literally clunky, but it's a mechanical marvel. Pressing the button is a feeling of accomplishment, even if it's just to increase the volume on the TV.",
