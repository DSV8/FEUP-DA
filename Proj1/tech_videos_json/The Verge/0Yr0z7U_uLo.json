    "transcript": "Creepy or cool? This is Boston Dynamics' new Atlas robot. Just one day after Boston Dynamics said it was retiring its humanoid robot, it announced the launch of a new, all-electric version, and the video I just shared kind of looks like something out of a horror movie. Atlas lays flat on the floor, but then its legs curl up behind its arms, allowing it to lift itself up and stand on two feet. Its head and torso then fully rotate so that it's facing the camera. It also comes with new AI and machine learning tools to help it adapt to real-life scenarios. Besides a refreshed design, Boston Dynamics says Atlas will be stronger and have a broader range of motion.",
