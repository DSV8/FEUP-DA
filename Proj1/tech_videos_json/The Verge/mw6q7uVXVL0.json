    "transcript": "Im in. I got the layout up. Tell me where you think you are. Copy that. The prison cells are in the southwest quadrant. Im on my way. Sit tight. Like I have a choice. So what am I up against? Well, theres only the one guard on duty. Thats not so bad. Because They have patrol drones. Shit! I think I spot you. All right, Im almost there. I need you to wave your arms in the air. Im sorry? Just do it. Hey! Stop! Dad! Youre grounded. Im a highly trained and decorated agent. And Im your father. Youre grounded. (coughing) Is he okay? Who? Come on. Lets get out of here! Its good to see you. That was close... We arent out of the woods yet. He really loves that simulation, huh? It's based off a movie we used to watch all the time when I was a kid. Being a hero instead of being in pain I figured it wouldnt be a bad way to spend his final days. Is he stable enough to continue? Okay, lets keep saving the world. Ready? Ready.",
