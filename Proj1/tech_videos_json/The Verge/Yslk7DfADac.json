    "transcript": "I think I understand now why humans kill, why they nearly destroyed their own planet. I carry your heart Because they die. But I never will. Do you feel ready? Ive been ready. Thats not what I asked. God, you dont even have lungs. Are you regretting it now? Regretting what? The child you and Rafael chose to send with me. You do not get to ask me that. I dont know how were going to do this without him. Is it lonely between calls? As the ship, there are endless complexities and a sense of calm. And as Benjamin? I carry your heart. They buried her beside Rafael. I called her Rafaela. And her world would be different. Didnt have to make the same mistakes. She would have me to teach her the stories of Earth, of her parents, Rafael and Jasmina, who gave everything to give her a better future. I carry your heart.",
