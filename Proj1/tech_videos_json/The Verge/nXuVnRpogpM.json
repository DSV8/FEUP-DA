    "transcript": "This is Sony's Project Q. It's the first PlayStation portable in a decade, but it doesn't play its own games. It streams them from your PS5 over your home Wi-Fi. It's basically an 8-inch, 1080p screen grafted onto a Dual Sense controller, complete with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. It's coming later this year. We don't know how much it costs, but it can't be too much if all it does is stream PS5 games. Here's hoping for a revamped Sony cloud gaming service to go with it.",
