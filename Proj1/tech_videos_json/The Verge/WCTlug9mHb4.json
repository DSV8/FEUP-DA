    "transcript": "This is the RealMe GT3. And it can charge from 0 to 100% in just 9 and a half minutes. It may not hold the crown for long if Redmi's latest concept device is anything to go by. That phone can charge up to 300W for total charge around 5 minutes. Oh, and there's also this very cool pulse in place in the back of phone which you can customize using a couple dozen different colors to show anything from incoming calls to low battery notification. I guess 2023 really is the year of fast charging and cool phone notifications. I'll take it.",
