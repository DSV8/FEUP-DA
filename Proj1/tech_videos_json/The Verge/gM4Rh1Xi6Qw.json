    "transcript": "(wind howling) (driver giggling) (electro upbeat music background) - [Narrator] This is the new Audi RS e-tron GT. It's a high-performance electric sedan built on the same platform as the Porsche Taycan. The RS version gets around 238 miles of range, which is nowhere near its competitors like Tesla Lucid. The base model RS starts at $140,000 but the e-tron GT is really meant to be the automakers standard-bearer as it shifts into more electric vehicles.",
