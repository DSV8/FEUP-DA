    "transcript": "New assignment from the boss: were building a robot dog. Should I even ask why? His dads dog is getting old, and he doesnt want his dad to get lonely when the dog dies. So he wants us to create an immortal dog machine to replace his fathers beloved pet after its eventual death? Yep. Isnt this kind of weird? Its morbid as hell and shows that our majority stakeholder doesnt understand how humans actually work, but this is not news. This is not a robot dog. Nope. Its a sensor array that records everything the dog sees and feels. When we get enough data, we can create a robot dog that will not only look but... act like the original. So were machine learning the dog. Pretty much. We have a problem. Theres been a death. The dog died? Nope. Shit. Now the dog is really depressed. He wants us to engineer a solution. He wants us to engineer a solution to a sad dog? Yep. How did you know? It just made sense. It just made sense to build a robot of our bosss dad from his dogs memories? Not just any robot. The best possible version of him. The one that his dog remembered. Thats the happiest dog Ive ever seen.",
