    "transcript": "Mark, I gotta be honest, not long ago I was thinking we may be doing this as like a post-fight interview in Las Vegas, right outside the octagon, after you get out of a fight with Elon. Maybe next year. Maybe next year? Not not, not Elon. I wanna keep competing, I just need to find somebody who actually -- Do you think he was ever serious about fighting? I don't know, you'd have to ask him. Are there any other tech CEO rivals you'd wanna fight if you could? No, I think it'll be more fun to fight someone who actually fights. So settling tech business rivalries by combat, you don't think that's become like a thing now. I don't think so no, I think generally that's not where our society is heading. Probably for the best. I guess what I'm saying is if he told you, he came back and said \"I'll fight on your terms, you pick the venue.\" Would you still do it? Yeah I just don't think it'll happen. Ok, fair. I agree with you.",
