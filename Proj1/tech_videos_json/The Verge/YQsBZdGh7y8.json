    "transcript": "Here's DJI's latest mini drone: The 4 Pro. The Mini 4 Pro looks almost identical to the 3 Pro, except for this extra set of sensors. These sensors enable 360 degree obstacle avoidance. The camera's almost unchanged. It still has the same sensor size and the aperture of f/1.7, but DJI claims better camera performance due to new image processing, and Dual Native ISO Fusion. This drone still records in 10 bit, 4k60, and HDR, and this year's model includes slow motion filming at 4k up to 100 frames per second. There's also the ability to take 48 megapixel photos. The Mini 4 Pro also has the new OcuSync 4, which enables video transmissions up to 20km, if you need that. But that also means you won't be able to use your old controller. Mini 4 Pro once again comes with two different kinds of batteries: ones that enable 34 minutes of flight time and keep your drone under 250 grams, and there's also the plus version, with flight times up to 45 minutes.",
