    "transcript": "- We're back at CES, one of the world's largest tech conventions and this year we've seen everything from wild car concepts to robots that clean up spilled milk, accessibility tech that will make everyday tasks easier for a whole host of folks. And of course, lots and lots of TVs, but only a few products really stuck out to us in this year's show. So here are our pics for the best of CES 2024. (upbeat instrumental music) - Here's what I want to take home from Vegas this year. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 with wheels that do this, it's easily the best thing I saw at CES 2024, as everyone hates parallel parking and this solves it with a snap of a finger. Oh and no more getting stuck in parking lots with no way to turn around. No more swerving around highway obstacles perhaps I don't want a TV or monitor from CES. I just want these wheels. It's called the Hyundai Mobis E-Corner System. While they haven't quite tested it at speeds over 50 miles per hour, yet the chief engineer told me he's got a couple years to get to freeway speeds before they take this amazing prototype to market. Cars should arrive as soon as 2028. He even claims it shouldn't cost much more than an ordinary steering system. They'll be marketing it to automakers globally, not just Hyundai. It is only for EVs. And I think EV makers are going to have a tough conversation about whether they're willing to ship cars that don't have sports car speeds in order to get these amazing wheels. - The biggest and most important trend in the smart home is smart energy. Smart lighting is fun and useful. Robot vacuums are life-changing and who doesn't love a smart toilet? But what makes it worth connecting all the things is smart energy management. Enter the Delta Pro Ultra, a whole home battery generator and its pal, the smart Home Panel 2. With these two gadgets, you can keep the lights on when the power goes out and the system can intelligently manage the loads in your home to help save you money and energy. There are a few similar options on the market today, and they're all excellent systems, but what I really like about the EcoFlow is that it's really simple to install. You just need an electrician to hook it up and it can also double as a portable generator. So you can power your RV or off-grid cabin in the woods. It's also modular so you can start small and slightly more affordably and build up to a whole home power management solution. This is a real shift in what's possible for home energy management, making it easier and more practical, something everyone can benefit from. - There are a lot of OLED monitors at CES this year, but one really stood out to me. Dell's Alienware, AW3225QF, what a name, has a Samsung Quantum-Dot OLED panel for 240 hertz high refresh rate 4K gaming. It's a 32 inch glossy OLED monitor with a slight 1700 R curve and an anti-reflective coating. 32 inches is the ideal 4K monitor size to me personally, I'm not an ultra wide fan and I've gotten used to using a curved 32 inch monitor for years to play competitive and single player games. I'm personally looking forward to an OLED upgrade for the response times, the image quality and of course the motion performance. Dell's 32 inch OLED monitor is also actually available to buy right now priced at $1,199. And if you're worried about burn-in, there's a free year warranty that covers this. There are also still lots of other OLED monitors on the way in 2024, but most don't have firm release dates yet or pricing. Still, I'm keeping my eye out for ASUS' 32 inch 4K, 240 hertz OLED monitor that can also double as a 480 hertz 1080p OLED screen. It looks like it's gonna be a great year for OLED monitors. - So smart rings, there were a ton of them at CES this year, but my pick for best wearable is the Evie Ring by Movano. It's a smart ring that's geared towards women's health. The design is very clever. It's got an open gap at the top. So when you are bloated or you're hormonal or your fingers are just swollen for whatever reason, it's gonna be easy to take off. 'cause like look, it's not coming off, right? The other thing that I really like about Movano is how dedicated they are to accuracy. The bonkers thing is that they don't actually need FDA clearance for the features on the ring. They're kind of flexing and saying, hey, we're so accurate that everything that we have meets FDA standards. You can trust us. Accuracy is pretty important for health tracking. So I'm super excited to get one in to test. My best pick for health tech is Dexcom's Stelo Continuous Glucose Monitor. It's designed for people who have type two diabetes but don't need insulin. And it's meant for them to have an affordable way to manage their condition and monitor their blood glucose levels on a day to day. So the combination of being affordable for people who don't have good insurance coverage and also targeting a underserved population within that community. It's very cool. It's getting FDA clearance now. It's expected to ship later this year. It's something that could positively affect the millions of people who have diabetes in this country. You'll have to see it. So those are my two best of picks. And you know, I'm really excited to review the Evie ring and I am also excited that people with type two diabetes who don't need insulin are about to get a more affordable option. - So the best car to show this year are actually two different cars and I'm lumping them together for reasons that will become clear in just a second. So the first is the Kia PV5, which is a futuristic modular electric vehicle that can change its size, it can change its interior, take out the steering wheel, it becomes a robo taxi, take out the back half of it, it becomes a mini electric truck. Endless possibilities. And the whole idea behind this is that Kia thinks that this is going to be perfect for businesses like ride hailing apps like Uber and Lyft. All sorts of things are envisioned as being some of the possibilities for the PV5. In fact, Uber has already signed a deal with Kia to be one of the first customers for the PV5when it goes into production in 2025. The second one I wanted to highlight is the Honda Space-Hub, which is part of the new Honda Zero global EV series that was first announced at the show. It's a boxy van type thing with no weird window, but plenty of glass to give passengers a panoramic view of the outside world. It's weird, it kind of looks like a vintage vacuum cleaner, but I think it has a lot of potential. Yeah, I think minivans are back, baby. You know, I have no idea if either of these things are ever gonna go into production or how much they're gonna cost, but as a middle aged dad with two kids, I just love seeing the minivan coming back into style. - Coming into CES, I was expecting a pretty slow year for TVs without any major news, but what do you know? It turned out to be a really fun show after all. It seems like each year we see OLED TVs get brighter than we ever thought possible. Many LED TVs are everywhere. We even saw some awesome projectors this year from LG, which has the retro stylish CineBeam Cube and Samsung's latest projectors can turn any surface you point them at into a touch screen, pretty nuts. There were even a lot of good speakers thrown in this year. Many of you were excited about Samsung's Music Frame, which looks like a picture on your wall. I think a lot of people love tech that just doesn't look like tech. Now we can't talk about TVs at CES without talking about LG's OLED T. That's the transparent TV that's made all the headlines this week. I saw it up close and it's really cool and it's nice to see years of prototypes actually turn into a real TV you can buy this year supposedly. But one question a lot of people had is why, who is this for? Why do you want to see behind your TV? And I still don't have a really great answer. It's a hell of a trick for sure. But outside of businesses and fancy doctor's offices or advertising, I'm not sure regular consumers are gonna have much interest in the OLED T, especially for the ungodly amount of money it's certain to cost. So if you want a real TV for normal people that I'm excited about, that would be Samsung's S95D QD OLED. The reason is this year Samsung gave the screen a glare free treatment that gets rid of basically any and all reflections, side by side on the show floor, the difference was super obvious when the S95D was next to a semi glossy OLED TV. I'm all about these quality of life improvements. They make a big difference. My only wish, just like any Samsung TV, is that the S95D would support Dolby Vision. Come on Samsung. How long are we gonna keep doing this? - It was such a blast being back at CES this year. One of my favorite demos was Sony's Afeela car, not as a car, but as a theater system. The speakers in there sound amazing, and there's speakers in the seat that rumble when something's playing. Ugh, it was so cool. But it's supposed to be a car, so TBD on how it performs on that front. As a theater though, it's pretty cool. But what did you see that you loved? Drop a comment down below. I'd love to hear your picks. I'm Becca, thank you so much for watching. I'll see you on the next one.",
