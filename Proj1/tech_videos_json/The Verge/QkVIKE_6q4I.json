The Verge’s Victoria Song says that the new bigger watches don’t feel clunky to wear, but it does feel noticeably lighter in her brief demo following Apple’s Glowtime event. The new Series 10 watches are also getting some new features like sleep apnea (not available yet), but are also getting some features that were previously reserved for the Ultra Watch like depth gauge.\nThe Ultra Watch didn’t get a big update this year, instead it got a new jet black color. #Apple #Smartwatch #Glowtime\n\nSubscribe: http://goo.gl/G5RXGs\nLike The Verge on Facebook: https://goo.gl/2P1aGc\nFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/XTWX61\nFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/7ZeLvX\nFollow on TikTok: http://bit.ly/42VeCVU\n\nThe Vergecast Podcast: https://pod.link/vergecast\nDecoder with Nilay Patel: https://link.chtbl.com/decoder\nMore about our podcasts: https://www.theverge.com/podcasts\n\nRead More: http://www.theverge.com\nCommunity guidelines: http://bit.ly/2D0hlAv\nWallpapers from The Verge: https://bit.ly/2xQXYJr\n\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may receive a commission without exerting any influence on editorial content.

    "transcript": "(upbeat jazzy music) - [Victoria] The Apple Watch series 10, we just got some hands on with it, and what I can say is this kind of feels like the ultrification of the regular Apple Watch. First off, there's a much bigger screen. It is technically the largest display of any Apple Watch ever, including the Ultra. We're going up from 41 millimeters and 45 millimeters to 42 millimeters and 46 millimeters. Now, the sizes have been creeping up ever since the Series 7 but I gotta say I tried both sizes on downstairs and you won't really notice it that much. The 42 millimeters still feels pretty good if you have a smaller wrist. It's also 10% thinner and 10% lighter. That doesn't sound like a lot, but I wear an Ultra 2 daily, and I could definitely feel the difference when I had it on my wrist. It's super light. I was just like, oh my God. So much lighter. We've got the Depth app coming over from the Ultra to the Series 10. So the big health update this time around is sleep apnea detection. Well, it's coming, eventually. When it gets regulatory clearance, which the FDA hasn't given yet, but Apple says is coming soon. Sleep apnea is when you're asleep, you stop breathing. It can be a really serious thing that's hard to detect for a lot of people. What's interesting about the way Apple's doing it is they're not using an SpO2 sensor. Instead, they're using an accelerometer verified against clinical data from a study that they ran themselves. So we'll find more about that in the coming days, but that should be super interesting, especially since the SpO2 sensors are currently the subject of a patent battle with Masimo. So now you know why that they cant release it now. There's a bunch of small hardware tweaks, like there's a metal back where the antennas are. You can use the speakers for anything other than a phone call now, like podcasts and music. But generally speaking, this pretty much still feels like the Apple Watch you know and love. But there's a lot of new finishes and colors this time around too. There's titanium with Rose Gold. We love the return of Rose Gold, but you know, all you Ultra fans have been complaining for a while. You don't have to complain anymore. There is a Black Ultra 2, it's not an Ultra 3, but it is a Black Ultra 2 alongside a new Jet Black option for the regular Series 10. And I gotta say the black is quite fetching. If Batman used a smartwatch, the Ultra 2 in black is the one that he would use. He'd be like, \"I'm Batman, this is my Ultra.\" That's 100% what he would do. So no more complaining. There's a darker Ultra 2 now. So the Apple Watch series 10 will be available starting Friday of September 20th. The regular model still the same price at $399, but if you want it in titanium, that starts at $699 because fancy material costs more. What are we doing?",
