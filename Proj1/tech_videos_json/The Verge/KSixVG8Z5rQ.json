    "transcript": "I have a lot of respect for Sundar and his team. Therefore I just want us to innovate, right? So there's always... we compete today. Today was a day where we brought some more competition to search. We've been at it. Believe me. I've been at it for 20 years and I've been waiting for it. But look, at the end of the day, they are the 800-pound gorilla on this. I hope that with our innovation they will come out and show that they can dance. And I want people to know that they can dance and I want people to know that we made them dance. And I think that will be a great day.",
