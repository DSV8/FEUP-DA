    "transcript": "This is what your friends will see when you call them on iOS 17. What depth, what full screen, and what a way to say \"Answer my call.\" These are Contact Posters, and they'll be available on iOS 17, which is the next big update from Apple, and it'll drop this fall. They're customizable cards that look a lot like the lock screens on iOS 16. You make your own poster by picking a photo or your Memoji. Portrait photos get this nice depth effect, and you can customize your card with different fonts, filters, and colors. So once you set it up and call a friend who has an iPhone with iOS 17, that's what they'll see. This feature's still in beta, so the final product might look a little different. You can also make custom cards for your friends if you want total creative control over how they show up on your phone. And, if you're feeling kind, you can even make one for the Android users in your life. That's so sweet. So the question is: Do you use an actual photo of yourself, or do you get creative and hope your friends pick the Contact Poster you made for yourself instead?",
