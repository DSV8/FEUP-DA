    "transcript": "I could get so much work done back here. Oh sorry. This is Umar with The Verge and I'm standing next to a Ram 1500 Rev that has 500 miles of range. It actually has a side storage piece here. You have it on both sides. Plus you can tow 14,000 pounds on this guy. Power of course on the side, you have 240 volt. You got a high amperage port right here. We got regular household outlets as well. We got a step right here that folds in once you close all the doors. Let's check out the rear seats. And we actually have like a full bench in the back. It looks pretty luxurious, nice, really comfortable leather seats. You also got two USB-C ports and two USB-A ports right here as well, plus a 110 volt port as well. We have a vertical touchscreen right here, this is their infotainment system. Sort of showing you a demo of what it's going to be looking like. Yippee-ki-yay. That's just for you.",
