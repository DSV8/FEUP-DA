    "transcript": "I'd say the initial response to the rebrand dramatically surpassed my expectations about kind of what could be achieved in terms of people hearing the vision that we wanted to put out there. I think like almost overnight, you know in the first few months, you had all these other companies sort of jumping in and talking about how they wanted to do stuff in the Metaverse too and I think it really popularized that term and that vision in a way that just dramatically exceeded what I'd actually expected. You look surprised. Well, it exceeded what... I'm surprised because it exceeded what I expected as well. The the way that Metaverse became a meme, in the business world, really everywhere, and now there's chief Metaverse officers at companies, right?",
