    "description": "The Mandalorian is the most popular show on Disney+ — and also the biggest television series overall right now. A big part of that is Baby Yoda. He’s cute, charming, and makes us want to watch week-after-week. He’s also a way for Disney to sell merchandise and capitalize on a character that immediately makes us go, “I want it.”\n\nSubscribe: http://goo.gl/G5RXGs\nLike The Verge on Facebook: https://goo.gl/2P1aGc\nFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/XTWX61\nFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/7ZeLvX\n\nWhy'd You Push That Button Podcast: https://pod.link/1295289748\nThe Vergecast Podcast: https://pod.link/430333725\nMore about our podcasts: https://www.theverge.com/podcasts\n\nRead More: http://www.theverge.com\nCommunity guidelines: http://bit.ly/2D0hlAv\nWallpapers from The Verge: https://bit.ly/2xQXYJr\n\nSubscribe to Verge Science on YouTube, a new home base for our explorations into the future of science: http://bit.ly/2FqJZMl",

    "transcript": "- Both Apple TV Plus and Disney Plus, launched a few weeks ago. But despite both launching with roughly the same amount of new, original TV shows, the only thing people can talk about is Baby Yoda. (baby cooing) - This is what was causing all the fuss? - [Julia] \"The Mandalorian\" is easily the most talked about show right now. Every week, Disney releases a short and sweet jolt of Star Wars action directly to our TV sets. We can wake up early every Friday morning and catch up with the Mandalorian and his adorable sidekick, Baby Yoda. - [Mandalorian] Bone broth for the little one. - Twitter is full of gifs, memes are running rampant and Disney Plus stays in the weekly conversation about being the next thing you must absolutely watch. Apple TV Plus doesn't have this for any of its' shows. \"The Morning Show\" fizzled out, no one is talking about \"See\" and Dickinson's fandom is contained to a corner of Tumblr. Even Disney's other series aren't garnering too much attention. Like \"The World According to Jeff Goldblum\" and \"High School Musical: The Musical: The Series\". Yes, that is the actual title. \"The Mandalorian\" is an absolute win for Disney. As the streaming service catapults to the front of people's must have subscriptions. It's also prime example of Disney using Disney Plus to recreate event television in the streaming age. And sell you as many t-shirts as possible along the way. (upbeat techno music) Of the 10 million people who signed up for Disney Plus on launch day, at least 2.1 million watched \"The Mandalorian\". Research shows it's also the most in demand show across the U.S. on any platform. There are entire podcasts dedicated to breaking down every episode and recapping each moment is a full time job for entertainment writers again. It's what critics call event television. A show that makes everything and everyone suddenly stop in order to watch. Whether that's \"Game of Thrones\" on Sunday nights or calling in sick the day a new season of \"Stranger Things\" drops on Netflix. The big difference between \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Stranger Things\" was how people watched it. And it gave us a look at how streaming could differ from cable. \"Game of Thrones\" was a weekly event. This most recent season was a six-week affair that kept people talking about the show for nearly two months straight. \"Stranger Things\" happens all at once. Excitement tends to die down after two or three weeks. Basically, after people have binged it. Meanwhile, \"Game of Thrones\" was pulling in viewers weekly and kept those viewers. Boasting record numbers for it's finale. For a long time, \"Stranger Things\" existed as an example of what event television could look like in the streaming age. \"The Mandalorian\" is a shake-up. Disney, echoing TV's more traditional formula is releasing its' Disney Plus episodes weekly. The company could release all of its' episodes at once but in doing so, risks having \"The Mandalorian\" be another show that people binge and forget about a week later. Instead, and this is the important bit, Disney is using the show as a launch pad for other holiday sales. Think of Disney Plus as an add-on for the company. Former Amazon Studios analyst, Matthew Ball noted that if companies actually want to make money, subscription streaming shouldn't even be your real business. Look at \"The Mandalorian\". The show offers endless merchandising opportunities. Disney, a company whose films help propel theme park attractions and cruise lines, knows this game better than most studios. (orchestra playing) Right now, \"The Mandalorian\" is tantalizing enough that it keeps people interested and more importantly, keeps them subscribed. Using Baby Yoda as incentive isn't something Disney's gonna be able to do, every single month going forward though. So, what happens after \"The Mandalorian\" ends and Baby Yoda disappears from the weekly discourse? Kevin Mayer, head of Disney's Direct-to-Consumer division actually spoke about this exact issue at a recent conference. - There's a lead time to create really high quality, original programming. So we have them coming on in a cadence that we think is the right cadence. We do have more originals that are coming out, at D23 we announced three or four Marvel series that are going to start coming out in several months. - Beginning in 2020, Disney will use its Marvel shows to play into its' big franchise films. And then let's look at 2021. Marvel has four movies that will be released in theaters. Between those releases, there are also several Marvel shows that will air weekly on Disney Plus. Some of these shows will also correspond to the events happening in some of these movies being released in theaters. For example, \"Wanda Vision\", a show that centers on Scarlet Witch and Vision from the Avengers series is actually gonna play into Doctor Strange 2, when those are released in 2021. Eventually, we're just gonna exist in a non-stop weekly cycle of Disney marketing. What it means for us, the people who are subscribed to Disney Plus or are thinking about it, is that Disney is gonna want its' streaming service to be at the center of weekly conversation. It might not be Baby Yoda in a few months but there will be something that keeps us talking about Disney Plus week after week and probably keeps us subscribed. Disney isn't the only company trying to keep you subscribed to their streaming service week after week. Companies like Apple are doing it too. To see how they're doing it, watch the first episode of The Verge, a Streaming Wars series.",
