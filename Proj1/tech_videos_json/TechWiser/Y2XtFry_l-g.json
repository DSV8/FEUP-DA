So to extend WiFi coverage, we have couple of options here. \n\nFirst, you can install a custom firmware (like DD-WRT) on your router \nand increase your WiFi range to few meters. \n\nHowever this is a bit more technical and if not done right \nthan it can even destroy your router and void your warranty. \n\n\nSecond best option we have is to use a power line adapter \nNow, power line is a revolutionize product that uses your \nhome electrical wiring to carry the WiFi signal. But as of now they are quite expensive and thus not feasible for home users\n\n\nNext, Popular option is to use WiFi repeater. \nSimply place this WiFi repeater in the range of your existing router \nand it will further boost the signal.  \n\nAnd last option, and also the one we are going to see in detail. \n\nis to boost wireless network by connect two routers with an ethernet cable. Technically it’s called creating an access point. \n\nAdvantages of this setup is that it’s cheap, \nworks well, and since we are using ethernet cable to share WiFi, \nit will work in the place where, there is no WiFi signal. \n\n\nSo let’s see how to make it work",
