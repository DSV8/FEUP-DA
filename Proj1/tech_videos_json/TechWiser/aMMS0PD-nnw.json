With Google Keep, you can extract text from any image whether it's a printout or in a digital form.\n\nWhy use Google Keep instead of other OCR reader\n\n#1 Accuracy -- I have tested this same image with few popular OCR reader in the market like -- EVERNOTE, CAMSCANNER PRO, ONENOTE, and ONLINE OCR etc. And I got the most accurate result from Google Keep. \n\n#2 Google Keep is free\n\n#3 No need to install any app, it works from the web version i.e. keep.google.com. Overall you can use it on every device you have.\n\nThe only downside is, you need an active internet connection to use it. \n\n\n[Resouces]\n\nI use Audio from YouTube audio library.\n\nCold Funk - Funkorama by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-...\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\n\nYou can reach me here\n\nWebsite - http://techwiser.com/\nYouTube - https://www.youtube.com/techwiser\nFacebook -https://www.facebook.com/techwiser\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/TechWiser\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/techwiser",
