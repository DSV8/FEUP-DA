Not just for security, but also for knowing if packages or food has been delivered to your porch; people dont always ring the doorbell. But this camera also recognizes who's at the door, reminds you to pick up your package and has no monthly fees. I think it's awesome that eufy Security now has a doorbell with TWO Cameras that record at the same time, and give the complete picture outside my door.

    "transcript": "Normal video doorbells have a problem. Yeah, they do a good job of seeing people that come up to the door and even act as a good doorbell, but one thing they really have an issue with is seeing all of these packages stacked up next to the door. If I was just looking through the doorbell I would have no idea these were here. Today though, Eufy Security has solved that problem by inventing a doorbell with two cameras. It makes you wonder why they didn't think of that sooner. Today we're going to see how it works and how it's installed. Let's get started. [Intro] I know it's a minor issue but it's always been a pet peeve of mine that I can't see anything right below the camera, whether it's packages or food being delivered. You can see that nothing is visible on this concrete patch which is where all the packages get set. There's a lot of real estate down here that I need to keep my eyes on. I've been using the Eufy Security setup in my office for a few years now so it's cool when Eufy comes out with cool upgrades that mesh into my already existing system. Inside the box we get the doorbell itself. It's a bit larger than the previous model but this time we get more tech inside. The 1080p camera down at the bottom is now paired with the 2K resolution main camera which has a 160 degree viewing angle. These two cameras combined working at the same time should let us see all the things. Plus, with both cameras working simultaneously, false motion detection alarms are reduced by 95%. Pairing the camera with my existing system is pretty simple. Just go into the Eufy app, add a device, find the doorbell, and then by scanning the QR code on the back of the doorbell and letting the doorbell scan the QR code on my phone, everything is paired to my system. It all took about 60 seconds. -[Doorbell speaker] Connecting to the wi-fi network. Please wait. -And then we get our first glimpse of how both cameras are working simultaneously. It'll probably look a little better outside once we get it mounted to the door frame. Mounting the camera is easy enough. Lucky for me it mounts in the same exact screw holes as the previous Eufy doorbell. And then the camera can just click into place. If the camera is hardwired there are a few more steps, but since I'm operating on battery power [doorbell sound] that's all I got to worry about. I can just pop it off the wall when it comes time to recharge. And there it is with the doorbell installed. We have about the exact same field of view as the previous camera, but now we have an additional space at the bottom where we can see the rest of the concrete patio. That worked out pretty well. And this is what the camera quality looks like with the 2K resolution up top and the 1080p camera down here at the bottom. Personally I'm not as concerned with resolution, but more now that I can see everything on my porch. The camera also has a feature called Delivery Guard, meaning it can remind you of a package just sitting there so you don't forget. And it can let you know when a package is approaching instead of only pinging you when the doorbell is rung. The camera can also be programmed to recognize family members or notify you if a stranger arrives. The doorbell has two options, one, it can be wired into your house, or it can operate off a battery. And Eufy says the battery lasts for about 6 months, and in my experience with the previous one, I get about 4 months out of it. I'm in a high traffic area and in Utah it gets super cold in the winter, so not quite reaching that 6 month range, but still it lasts for a really long time. So it's night time right now and you can see when it senses someone walking up it turns on two LEDs down here at the bottom to softly illuminate the boxes. And this is what the 2K camera looks like at night along with the 1080p camera down below. It's about 9:00 in the evening right now so it is pretty late and pretty dark. I'll leave a link down in the description so you get the current pricing of the doorbell and huge thanks to Eufy for sponsoring this video and solving the problem of not being able to see my porch.
