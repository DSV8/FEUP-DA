    "transcript": "Today Im going to show you something that just might save your life. This could be the most important video that Ive made all year. [Intro] Every single year disasters happen all around the globe; tsunamis, wars, fires, tornadoesanything could happen. Whether youre ready or not theres always a chance that you might be involved in a natural disaster. The first 3 days, or 72 hours, are the most important after a disaster occurs because thats how long it takes for help to arrive. During those 2 or 3 days while youre waiting for help to arrive, its good to have something called a 72 Hour Kit or a Bug-Out Bag full of necessities and food and water. You can put whatever you want in your 72 Hour Kitlike a first aid kit. Flashlights are pretty important. Might be nice to have a little bit of ropesomething to start a fire with. The single most important thing you can have in your 72 Hour Kit is 3 days worth of pure clean water. If you havent guessed yet, Im building more than one 72 Hour Kit and Ill tell you why in just one second. But if you ever find yourself in a disaster situation with a little bit of forewarning like you would with a flood or a hurricane, make sure you fill your bathtub up with water and put a stopper in it. That way you have enough fresh pure clean water for a couple days. Gotta get some of the other necessities. The second most important thing you need after water is food. Now these things dont taste very good, but theyre small, have a lot of calories and a super long shelf life. You can find these at a lot of grocery stores and sporting good stores, but Ill try to link some down in the video description as well. Keep in mind that if youre going to build a 72 Hour Kit, you really dont have to buy anything. You can get food and water and just stick it in a backpack. Just make sure its enough for 3 days. So to recap, we have fire, light, first aid, hygenics, rope, trail mix which is actually super high calories and doesnt take up a lot of space. I think each one of these bags has about 3500 calories in it. We have knives. We have a rain poncho; these were actually really cheap. We have some more food. Remember these dont take up a lot of space, but theyre super high calories. And most importantly, we have water. And last but not least, it helps if you have a water proof bag to put everything inside. If you dont have a water proof bag you can always use a trash bag, something cheap. Remember you dont have to spend a lot of money on this. The most important thing is that you have one. You dont have to put the same things that I put in my kit in your own kit. You can personalize it by adding clothes, medication, you can also put identification in there. The most important thing is is that you have enough food and water for 3 daysor more days if you have enough money and space to store it. More is better. That way, whether its a regular apocalypse or a zombie apocalypse, youre going to be prepared. Christmas is coming soon here in the United States and in the spirit of Christmas Ill be donating these kits here locally to people who need them. Its one of the small ways that I can #LIGHT the WORLD or make the world a better place. It doesnt matter if you celebrate Christmas or Hanukah or any of the other holidays, or even if you hate holidays, these are something good to have. And its also something good to giveespecially because it might save a life. If you end up making one of these for yourself or giving it as a gift to a friend or family member, take a picture and tag me on Instagram or Twitter or Facebook with the hash tag #LIGHTtheWORLD so I can see what you made. And together we can make the world a better place by being prepared. Thanks a ton for watching. Ill see you around.",
