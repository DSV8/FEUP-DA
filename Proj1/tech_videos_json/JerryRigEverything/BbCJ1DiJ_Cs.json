    "transcript": "Alright. So, it's been about 5 months since my last Q and A, and I figured it was high time for another one. So I asked over on Twitter what questions you guys had for me, and here are a couple of them. A question I got a lot of actually is: What's my daily driver? I'm still using the Galaxy S8 Plus. I don't think the Galaxy S9 was enough of a change to warrant a full switch of my device. But I'm a hardware guy, not a software guy, and the Galaxy S8 is working just fine for me. Alright so first question is: When are you going to do some mods for your Tacoma? Um this might be a surprise to some of you but I do have a second channel which I've done a couple small mods on. I mostly reserve that channel for smaller things. I don't want it to turn into a full scale production for this channel, but I put a roof rack on my truck, and at the end of this week I will be getting a lift for my truck. I'm going to jack it up about 3 inches and put some bigger tires on it. That I'll put on this main channel. I'll link my second channel down in the description, it's just ZacksJerryRig...same as all my social medias. And then I will also be putting a light bar on my truck inbetween the roof racks, but I'm not sure if I'm going to stick that on the main channel or the second channel. But the Tacoma is still running great. I've put about 6,000 miles on it and I've had it for about 3 months. Still love it. Next question: Where do the phones go after you test them? I actually have a stack of phones over there in the corner. I actually keep all of the phones that I do tests on just in case I need to reference them in other videos. So I don't give them away. But at the end of their lifespan, you know, after they aren't relevant anymore after a couple years, I do harvest the parts and use them for other broken phones, or I sell them or recycle them. Nothing ever gets wasted and nothing ever gets thrown out here on my channel. Speaking of breaking things: Have you ever broken something, like a leg or an arm? So I've never actually broken a bone. I've sprained my ankle a couple times jumping off of buildings, but no broken bones. I have had stitches a lot though, which brings us to our next question: What's your worst injury from trying to fix things? When I was about 8 years old I had a coping saw, it's a little handheld saw that my grandpa gave me, Grandpa Jerry. And I was actually...it's the scare you can see on my thumb in the majority of my videos. I was making flying pencil people out of wood. I had a little artwork that I drew on the piece of wood and I was using the coping saw to cut around it, and the saw was so sharp I cut right through my finger. It was deep enough that I needed stitches, but not deep enough that I was worried about losing my thumb or anything. But yeah, if you've ever wondered why I have that scar in some of my videos, it's because 8 year old me had some projects he was working on. Next tweet was: Have you ever crashed a car? And the answer to that is yes. Back in high school I was working construction and I pulled an all-nighter with a concrete pour, that you have to start at night and then finish the huge slab during the day. And so I drove back home after like 24 hours of no sleep and working hard, and I ended up crashing my truck and totaling it. So this is a picture of that. And the hair you see in the picture is real. And the damage to the truck is also real. I've had a few minor dents and things in my vehicles since then, but nothing as serious as that one. Have you ever thought about opening a PO Box? Yes actually. I do have a PO Box. I've put it in some of the descriptions of my videos. I will put that also right here. If you want to send me stuff for review or just send me stuff in general, you can always do that. I will also have it linked in the About section of my channel. So if you're watching this video a couple years from now, make sure it's up to date. I like this question: Do you have an engineering degree or any higher education degree, and do you consider it as something important? Something important yes, and no. I did graduate college with a bachelors in business, so I do have that, you know, higher degree, but I've never actually used it. I always knew that I was going to work for myself after I was done with school. I've always had that entrepreneurial mindset even as a little kid. But I was never the biggest fan of school in general, where you had to sit down and look at the teacher and learn a bunch of fluff stuff in order to get to the more important materials. And it was super irksome when they would pull up a YouTube video, that I could find for free on the internet myself, and they would play it in class that I was paying thousands of dollars for. That was frustrating. So I feel like a motivated person can learn the exact same thing for free online and they don't necessarily need to go to college to get that piece of paper, the degree. But that piece of paper is incredibly important if you're going to be hired for a job in the future, so that companies know you actually put in the effort and learned something. People always point out that, oh, Steve Jobs dropped out of school, or Bill Gates dropped out of school, and yeah that's true. They didn't graduate from college, but at the same time they already had something in place making them money before they dropped out. So if you have a plan and it's successful, then maybe school is not the most important thing, but until you have something in place that is working, stay in school, graduate, and get that degree as a good back up plan. Plus being in school around people in the same degree as you is like the best way to network, and you can use those connections throughout your entire life. Networking is almost more important than the actual knowledge you have. But yeah, I did graduate, and school is good for the most part. Another question: Why are newer phones getting harder and harder to repair? And to answer this I would have to say aesthetics for one. I mean first and foremost, people want to buy phones that look good and hard to repair phones, you know, that hide the screws and are using premium materials, those look good and people want to buy them. But also, very close to that first point, a repairable phone lasts longer and therefore companies like Apple or Samsung make less money if people can easily fix them. And personally, I'm hoping that by running the largest cellphone repair channel on the Internet, that I'm helping you, the viewer, the customer, save money and keep money in their own pocket. Because the best way to recycle a cellphone is to keep it alive as long as possible and prolong that lifespan before you have to buy something else. Which is kind of why I'm still using the Galaxy S8 and not directly switching to the Galaxy S9 because I just don't need it right now. Are you a full time YouTuber? Yes. I've had my channel for about 6 years now, and for the last 3 of those I've been full time YouTube. I still have side projects here and there that I do, but YouTube is my main venture. And surprisingly there are a lot of questions about this too: How much time per week do you put in at the gym? So since YouTube is my full-time job and I work for myself, the gym is one of the only places where I get social interaction, and so I go there pretty much every day. I got a lot of questions on what I do at the gym. I usually start off with cardio and try to burn anywhere from 300-600 calories doing cardio, and then the rest of the week I space out different weight lifting activities with free weights and benching and stuff like that. I don't feel like I can legitimately start my day until I've already been to the gym. It's become a habit at this point. And I really enjoy it so it's fun. What percentage of my audience is from different parts of the world? So I actually looked this up and the last 30 days... I'll put this right here...about 30% of my audience is from the United States, 12% is from India, 6% from the UK, 3% from Germany, and 3% from Canada. You can kind of see it cycling down along the bottom there. The other 48% is from the rest of the country, so it's a pretty world wide audience. Most of those are from the ages of 18-35 and they are male. For example, if you look at the last video I put out, This is a Drone where I reviewed that egg drone, 1% of the viewers of that video were female. Which brings us to our next question: Do you have a girlfriend? And no, I do not. I have to work on getting those female metrics up past 1%. Can you speak Spanish? Si hombre. Hablo un poco. Aprendi mi espaniol in Guatemala. I learned my Spanish in Guatemala. I lived in Guatemala for 2 years when I was 19 years old serving a mission for my church. Have you ever seen those two guys walking around in a white shirt and tie? I was one of those Mormon missionaries. But after the 2 year mission is up, you go home and live your life like a normal person just as a normal member of the church again. It was definitely a cool experience. And while I was there, I learned Spanish. Next question: Did you always live in Utah, and how did you meet What's Inside? So I did all of my high school years here in Utah, so I count that as pretty much growing up, you know, besides the 2 years in Guatemala. And I actually...so What's Inside lives here in Utah as well, but we actually met in Ireland at a video conference called the Power of Video talking about YouTube and stuff to the people of Northern Ireland. But after that we came back, that was about 2 years ago, and we've been friends ever since. YouTube is kind of a very unique career choice, and so it's nice having someone who does the same thing that you can kind of connect with. Plus, we both like taking stuff apart, so it's a win-win situation. If you have any questions that I didn't get around to answering or I haven't answered in my other Q and A's, go ahead and leave them down in the comments. I'll be there for a couple hours after this video is posted answering those questions. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. I got a bunch more truck videos, cellphone repair videos, and durability tests, coming up in the near future. Come follow me on Twitter so you can be part of the next question and answer. And I'll see you on Instagram. Thanks a ton for watching, and I will see you around.",
