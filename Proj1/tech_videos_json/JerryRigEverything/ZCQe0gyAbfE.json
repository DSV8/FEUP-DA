    "transcript": "Zack: Four years ago we launched our original off-road Not A Wheelchair called The Rig. Cambry: Now 4 years later it's time we release our new machine with four times the motor and four times the power. Zack: It is the world's lightest four-wheel drive accessible vehicle, and we are calling it, The Big Rig. We've been prototyping the Big Rig for the past four years. Our whole goal here at Not A Wheelchair is to mass-produce affordable, accessible equipment, and this Big Rig takes accessibility to a whole new level. Since now sitting in a Big Rig makes nearly any type of terrain accessible. All while weighing only 210 lb. I'm pretty biased, obviously, but it's not all sunshine and roses and we'll get to that in a second. But first let me show you what's new. We have four individual completely silent 1,000 watt ebike hub motors. Which are mounted into standard off the shelf 20 by 4 fat bike tires. With a large motor controller in the center behind the slidable seat. There are two side mounted ebike batteries and of course a pre-installed mounting bracket for our rear rack and accessories. All on top of a much beefier suspension system. Cambry: All the operation happens here with the thumb throttle, two handheld hydraulic brakes, and two steering rods that are upright. And one little button for reverse. We also still have the drop- down handlebars for easier side entry. Zack: We've been testing the big rig in as many extreme situations as possible. Taylor and Dade led the expedition through the snow covered Rocky Mountains. Taylor: I feel like I'm in Twilight. Dade: Twilight haha. Zack: These things there's a an electric motor in each of the four tires. Which is four times more powerful than our previous version, and obviously as you can tell it is extremely quiet. Which makes like traveling through this winter wonderland even that much more serene. Uphill through mushy snow gave the Big Rig a run for its money, but we're also venturing into territory where historically wheelchairs just aren't meant to be and have never been before. Taylor: Dude these are awesome I can't even think of like one other like device that could do this. It's just so cool to be up here. Hi I thought that was a deer. Zack: Sandy beaches are the arch nemesis of any wheel vehicle especially, wheelchairs. But having power to all four wheels on the Big Rig along with airing down the tires definitely improves the performance on soft sand. And while the Big Rig can perform at these extreme ends of the spectrum. It definitely feels most at home on dirt roads and backcountry hiking trails. Each one of the four motors is nominally rated at 1,000 Watts. But in the top level five driving mode, which I wouldn't recommend accessing until you're ready, the Big Rig can pull 7 kilowatts worth of power in a 20 second burst. Which gets you to the top speed of 13 mph extremely quickly. With more power we've also increased the weight capacity from 225 lb on our regular Rig to 275 lb for the passenger and cargo on the Big Rig. Not only that but the Big Rig also has the ability to tow a 200 lb payload for almost 15 to 20 miles across relatively flat terrain. With our custom Not A Wheelchair gooseneck trailer we've designed it specifically so that Jack knifing is a good thing allowing the rider to access whatever's in the trailer without having to get out of the seat. Which is very useful on a farm or camping trip. Cambry: Speaking of which, you might be curious as to where the Big Rig can go. And according to the American Disability Act or the ADA. Other power-driven mobility devices are allowed to go in the same areas where members of the public are allowed to go. So if you're driving the Big Rig and you have a medically recognized physical impairment you can basically go anywhere outdoors that's open to the public. As long as it's safe. Zack: This is definitely not an indoor machine. Cambry: But if you want to buy one and don't have a medically recognized physical impairment. You still can ride it, of course, but there's more restrictions on where you can go. Zack: For example some parks might limit bikes or ebikes but mobility devices for obvious reasons are allowed. And with the Big Rig being so exceptionally quiet Mother Nature herself won't even know you're driving through. Mother Nature though at times is inhospitable to these normal off-the-shelf 20 by 4 bike tires and a flat tire could really ruin someone's day. Which is why we've partnered directly with Tannus armor Tire inserts to protect our inner tubes against 95% of common bike Flats. Thanks to Tannus every single Big Rig will come with a complete set of nearly Invincible Tannus armor Tire inserts for free. If these bike tires can survive 50 Staples they can handle Mother Nature just fine. Tannus makes armor inserts for regular bikes too and you should totally check them out. Keep in mind that the Big Rig is not a finely tuned medical device it's sitting right there at that perfect Pinnacle of price, power, and weight. All balanced perfectly to make the most capable, and efficient, and lightest off-road machine possible. However, while being the world's lightest four-wheel drive accessible vehicle 200 lb is still 200 lb. So we also have a motorized electric self-loading rig rack for easier transportability. The driver can park the rig into the self- loading rig rack, ratchet down the tires, and the hoist handles all the hefty lifting automatically. With the front bumper off the Big Rig is exactly 5 ft long 33 inches wide and 2 and 1/2 ft tall with the seat folded down. Making it quite nice to transport in the bed of a truck, the back of a Jeep, or a Subaru. If you're able to lift it up into place. You might be asking is the Big Rig perfect? And the answer to that is, absolutely not. We are trying to mass-produce the most affordable off-road machines possible but with that come some trade-offs for example there's no traction control containing wheel slippage that you might encounter in some more extreme off-roading situations. We've mitigated this issue by giving the Big Rig nearly 6 inches of front suspension and wheel articulation to help maintain positive traction. But keeping all four wheels on the ground is something to keep in mind. Hub motors also while exceptionally quiet aren't known for their torness. So starting on a steep slope or in super deep sand with a heavy payload is its Achilles heel. And there's just some laws of physics that we can avoid the heavier the payload the more diminished the climbing performance. A 275 lb rider won't be able to climb the same slopes as a 200 lb rider. Physics. Cambry: We've teamed up with the largest trike manufacturer in the USA, Utah Trikes, to manufacture these, and they can be shipped now. Zack: And you might think that with four times the power and four times the motor it would also be four times the price, but that's not the case. We're still shipping our original two wheel drive rig for $5,099. And the four-wheel drive Big Rig is just shy of 12,500 at Not A Wheelchair.com. Both versions are thousands of dollars cheaper than other similarly capable devices. Cambry and I don't make any money from the sale of these machines and it won't hurt our feelings if you shop around. You most definitely should. We are really excited about this Big Rig but everyone is different and that is totally okay. If you want to help support our project though and our movement to help make accessibility more affordable. You can always pick up one of our annual collector's coins where 100% of the proceeds go towards making these devices cheaper for those who need them. The coins are just 15 bucks and we make a new one every year. If you get a coin in the next two weeks Cambry and I will include a signed thank you card, cuz your help is what makes all of this possible. Cambry: Just remember be safe, use a buddy system, wear a helmet, and have fun. Zack: Thanks a ton for watching. Cambry: We'll see you around.",
