    "transcript": "Prime Day is forthcoming which means a barrage of sponsored videos filled with crappy products nobody cares about from lame YouTubersNOT THIS ONE THOUGH! Well, I'm lame, but the products are cool! Ive got 20 that you've never heard of but will loveand only 1 of them is sponsored. I dunno if there's deals on this stuffsome of these products aren't even available on Amazonthis is basically just like... things I likethat I want to talk about. So, sit down and shut up, okay? Look, Ive never been a Bluetooth speaker guy. Ive tried tonsat all price pointsbut Ive never found anything I think sounds good while keeping a small footprint and price. That has changed with the new BIGGIE from well-known HiFi brand Morel. Remove the magnetic grille and youll find both a 4 front-ported woofer and 1 soft-dome tweeter powered by a surprisingly punchy 60W amplifier. The built-in DSP utilizes both drivers wellwith the woofer putting out a remarkable amount of bass, and the tweeter sinking down into the upper-mids for vocals. I wont bore you with the details, but you can use on-device EQ to kinda make this sound however you wantits really versatile. And with BT 5.3 support its pretty well future-proofed affording multi-device pairing and incredible range; however, Morel hasnt forgotten the staples: it comes with a line-in portand you can both charge or power the speaker entirely over USB-C. Theyre promising a lot more for the future: stereo support if youve got two, in addition to a smartphone app for tuning. Whether Morel will actually deliver on this is anyones guess, and at $300, its not cheap, but it sounds better than any other battery-powered, portable speaker Ive listened to, and I really like itespecially all the lacquered wood color options. Smart Home temperature and humidity sensors sucktheyre poorly calibrated, slow to recognize a change from delta, unreliable, and expensive. Nothing works as well as those old AcuRite sensors that grandpa had hooked up to his weather station in the 90s. So why not USE grandpas AcuRite sensors from the 90s? These radio-based plastic-fantastics are crazy accurate, update every 16 seconds, last nearly a year on a pair of AAA batteries, and cost just $16. The problem? Theyre not designed for smart home useat all. But open-source software knows no bounds and with an inexpensive USB radio receiver, you can use MQTT and Home Assistnat toadd these old-school sensors to any smart home environment and automate accordingly. Its very simple and there are great guides to get started that Ill link below. This is one of those things where once you try it, youll wonder why you ever considered doing it the proper way. Todays sponsor is a product Ive been using twice daily for over 6 monthsthe Laifen electronic toothbrush. Look, heres the deal: I moved to soft-bristled Philips ultrasonic toothbrushes a decade ago due to receding gum lines. Their brush head prices are insane, so I tried to move to other ultrasonic brushes but they all sucked with weak vibration and lousy battery. That is, until this one. Not only does it ultrasonically vibrate as well or better than the Sonicare stuff, but the head even oscillates which I thought may have been a BS feature until my dentist at my most recent checkup just a few weeks ago told me he could tell Ive been flossing due to low tartar levels and to keep it up. PsstI suck at flossingso it must have been this brush. Beyond the cleaning capabilities, it looks fantastic, coming in ABS, aluminum (my favorite), or stainless steel. Battery lasts for months and it charges via a MagSafe style USB-C connector. You wont collect pud underneath the brush head like other brushes, and the heads themselves are shockingly affordableonly $9.99 for a 3 pack. Its rare that I dont have a single complaint or criticism about a productbut I truly dont. Even the app is well done but you also dont have to use it if you dont want by saving cleaning profiles to the brush itself. I bought one for my wife and have recommended it to friends and family. If its time for a new toothbrush, this is the one to get. Save up to 20%, the best deal since it launched, using the link below. I have been using my iPad a ton lately, but the fingerprints I get on the display drive me madand because they use a different oleophobic coating to remain compatible with the Apple Pencil, grease is nearly impossible to wipe awayno shirt rub trick here. Thus, these little self-contained screen cleaners have been a savior. Basically, theres a little spray bottle located inside a square microfiber case. Spray the fluid, use one side to spread it around, another to buff, and another to wipe dry! When youre finished, you can put it back in its plastic sheath to stay clean. Even though theyre cheap, theyre resuable since you can refill the fluid and clean the microfiber with a bit of dish soap, water, and 24 hours of dry time. I keep one in my laptop bag, one in my car, and one in my home office. Theyre hyper-generic and available from tons of sellers so just get the best deal you can to enjoy a portable, all-in-one display cleaner! This upcoming Prime Day, youre gonna see deep discounts on Kindleswe always dobut I have some more advanced E-Ink devices to recommend. First up, the Kobo Sage: my e-reader of choice. Its spacious 8 display with 300 ppi renders text superblynot just those through the Kobo Store, but any file uploaded to Dropbox and Google Drive. Better yet, you can rent books for free directly on-device from your local library using OverDriveI havent bought a book in a long time. Libraries are awesome. The device even supports pen input for notes and PDF markup. Next, the Boox Palma. Ive fallen in love with this thing. Its basically an Android phonewithout a phone or a typical display. The 300 ppi screen is best-in-class and in addition to the surprisingly good software thats pre-loaded, you have full Play Store access to use whatever reader apps you wanteven Kindle or Kobo! And because its Android, you can do a lot moreeven watch YouTube videos quite miserably with its fast-refresh display. I mean, for E-Ink, it really is pretty good. The price is up there at about $280, but Ive found myself just putting this in my pocket. I read books and articles when Im waiting in line, on the toilet, basically everywhere. Its the anti-phone substitute device and its great. Do you have a stinky, poopy butt? If you havent joined the rest of us civilized folk in the bidet revolution, you do. Washlets are a game-changer, but and permit me to get a little bit, uh, well it has turned my little anus into a pampered royal who expects nothing less than the gentlest of treatments. One wrong move, a couple days with single-ply toilet sandpaper, and its like my rump has been dragged across a cheese grater. Thus, I have purchased that which my wife pleaded I nota portable ass blaster from Toto. The design is cleveryou extend the weapon by cocking which creates a reservoir kept sealed by an internal o-ring. Fill it up with some warm tap water, fold out the wand, select low-or-high pressure (youll want the latter), position it abroad as you would at home, and press the button. It works surprisingly well. No, it wont give you the volume or pressure youd expect from the real deal, but it gets you 90% of the way there requiring just one or two safety wipes using paper. The only complaint I have is that it is powered by a single AA battery like its 1994. Said battery is only good for about a dozen cleanses before the power starts to taper off quite aggressively. A USB-C model is long overdue, but Japan is famous for being both 20-years ahead and 30-years behind, so I wouldnt count on itjust get this one on a deep discount instead and take it everywhere you travel. Inside your travel bag, you may also want a GENKI ConvertDock 2. Youve probably heard of the originalit allowed you to travel with a Nintendo Switch and play it at a hotel without the dock. USB-C would supply power to the device and HDMI out would supply video to the TV. Think that, but with the addition of a USB-A port. What is this for? Ah, USB in! So bear with me 4K60 HDMI out, USB-in, 45W USB-C PD for power and two-way data. This means you can plug innot just your Switch, but also your Steam Deck or MacBook even iPhone to a TV while charging your device; and you can supply any USB input your heart can think ofa game pad, ethernet, external storage, keyboard, etc. Screw dongles pack light and bring this one-device does all gem with you anywhere you go. Its time to talk about another expensive audio gadgetsorry! These, are the Focal Bathys bluetooth headphones. OK, theyre $700, BUT they put every other Bluetooth headphone to shame and its not close. They have most of the features youd expect from Bluetooth headphones in this day and agenoise cancelling, transparency mode, multi-device support, a wired 3.5mm or USB-C lossless mode, a simple, but functional app, and a premium but lightweight, mostly-plastic build. Those features are not the staplesand frankly, theyre not even the strengths. The ANC is fine, not great, the passthrough is pretty lousy compared to Apple or Sony, the buttons are confusing, and battery life is adequate. So what do they excel at? Comfort, and sound. These are without a doubt the comfiest wireless headphones Ive wornmaybe the comfiest headphones ever, and their sound? Oh, their sound is *muah*. Objectively, theyre pretty close to the Harman combined target curve. Subjectively, theyre so much more when you get them it has you do a hearing test through the app that builds a user-specific EQ. Mine resulted in a punchy low-end, great mids, subdued but not overly dark trebles, and yeah all the stuff youd expect from a high-end closed-back headphone: decent if not impressive soundstage, nice imaging, the works. It even supports Dolby Atmos via Apple Music if youre into that. These headphones are nearing 2-years-old, so its possible a refresh is in the worksand look, I get it theyre expensive. The average user wont care about them, but if youre an audio-chad, youll never want to carry around anything else after trying thesetheyre brilliant. I am not known around my home for keeping very good track of things. I use AirTags for a lot of stuff, but my wallet is an important item I find myself misplacing oftenespecially now that I usually leave it at home thanks to NFC payments being accepted almost everywhere I go and Utahs ugly Mobile ID app. The thing is AirTag wallets are all garbagenobody wants something that thick and inflexible on their rump. So, I converted to the new Nomad Tracking Card. This thing is only $40, integrates seamlessly with the Find My network, has an integrated beeper for easy locating once youre in range, and has a 5-month battery life. Unlike a lot of these things youve gotta chuck once the battery dies, this thing charges over MagSafe. Its about the thickness of 2 credit cards, is flexible, water proof, and wonderful. Buy oneif theyre not already sold out. This next one is a little overpriced, and there are competing products that Im sure do a fine job, but the Patagonia Black Hole duffel bag has my heart. This bag comes in a variety of sizesIve got the smallest 40Land what I love about it is that it basically doesnt exist. You see, the whole bag weighs just a little more than a t-shirttheres no organizers or dividers save for two amorphous pocketsyou do get caribiner loops, a vertical grab handle, horizontal handle and optional shoulder straps, but thats it. Its almost featurelessand that is its feature. This thing is perfect as a carry-on for planes because it fits an insane amount of stuff thanks to the lack of rigid walls your gear has to conform to. Whats more, the TPU material is incredibly water resistantIve been in heavy rain camping with this and had zero issues. When youre all done, it folds up into its own self-contained pocket pouch. Its my go-to weekender bag and will be for probably decades to come thanks to its insane stitching and material quality. This glossy variant is no longer availablePatagonia now uses matte, recycled TPU, but everything else has remained the same and thats a good thing. Like it or not, you deal with a lot of cardboardand cardboard boxes are a pain. I admit, I have been pretty terrible at breaking them down as Im instructed to by my local recycler, but thats about to change with the Canary cardboard cutter. This tool, made in Japan, is astoundingly good and will put any utility knife to shame. Not only does it absolutely shred through packing straps, shrink wrap, and tape (thanks to its non-stick coating), but the serrated safety-blade allows for excellent maneuverability when cutting cardboardits so precise, you can even cut circles out of your boxes. Even better, the rounded chisel tip is perfect for peeling-off old labels and making shallow scour cuts to fold on when resizing boxes. It works on cardboard both thick and thin, stays sharp for a crazy long time and is inexpensive enough its worth getting a few to place around the house. The temperature delta between the surface of the sun and my back patio is only about 20 degrees during dinner-time when I need to grill. Ive tried umbrellas, neck coolers, and morenothing works and the miserable heat remains. I considered getting high-pressure mist, but those systems cost hundreds (even thousands of dollars), and on windless days, really only serve to make things MORE humid and muggy. I dunno if youve seen the price of outdoor rated fans, but theyre insane; so, when I saw the Lasko Misto for $80 at Costco I thought it would be terrible. Turns out, I wasnt wrongI was simply mistakenthis thing is superb. Its an outdoor-rated fan that blows at 3 speeds and can optionally oscillate back and forth. But, hook it up to a hose bib and suddenly youve got 3 misting heads that spray fine water beadlets into the fans path, providing a remarkably good cooling effect. Now, its not perfect: this isnt pressurized mistso stand within a few feet of the thing and youll get pretty wet. Furthermore, the mist volume isnt variableits on or off. That said, the fans throw is about 20-25 feet which means you can stay very cool (whilst remaining dry) being even remotely nearby. The 6-foot cable is on the short side, but inline GFCI is nice and the build quality is so surpringly excellent, it feels 2-3x its price. If youve got a hot patio and youre on a budget, this is the antidote. Ya like cheese?? Of course you do, youre not a filthy communist. When we got married, we put the Wirecutter cheese-grater recommendation on our wedding registry. Its really sharp and it still sucks. Man invented the wheel 6,000 years agoso why not use it? This cheapo grater uses the power of rotational leverage to absolutely churn through any cheese you throw at it and the crazy-strong suction base prevents it from moving so you can crank out that mozzarella like youre 14 all over again. This next one isnt for sale on Amazonand Im not even sure I should recommend it because its so niche, but I just think its the neatest thing ever we recently re-did our landscapingit looks great and we love it, but we have this tiny patch of grass at the back of the house we didnt want to run a sprinkler zone to (wed have needed to dig up the driveway), so I bought this: its called Oto and its basically a 3D printer for your yard. Using a variable valve and servo head it throws water exactly where and when you want. Using an app, you create a point cloud volume or single-point zone that it throws water on. You set it up just like a regular smart sprinkler timerit can skip for weather or in high windsand because its designed to work on more than just grass, you can, for example, perform deep root watering on nearby trees rather than having to run drip irrigation. The device itself is pretty reasonable because their goal is to sell you solutions like fertilizer, mosquito control, and acid neutralizer for dog peesolutions I think work pretty well so Ive been suckered into buying them, but you totally dont need to. You can use it for just watering. Its a weird toy, but such a great one. Not everybody can finger a piece of protein like Gordon Ramsay and determine its cook temperaturethermometers never killed anybody. I use probes from Combustion Inc. and LOVE them. They have thermistors down the length of the whole probe so you just jam it in there and it finds the core temp so you dont have to. Theres an app, but you can also use their nice, monochrome LCD; it accounts for your cooks time of completion in real-time, and because it just spits out an unencrypted Bluetooth signal with open-source libraries available for anyone to use, tons of cooking apps, grills, and ranges support these probes natively. The only problem? Theyre a tad pricey. For those on a budget, check out Chef iQs smart probes. They dont have the cool TrueCore temperature functionalitytheres just a single internal and external thermistor; however, they do almost everything else the Combustion probes do. The app is well designed; it even has step-by-step video instructions for a lot of recipes if youre new to cooking and the speaker dock provides audible alerts. Last, a tool for huge grill nerds: this is the FireBoard 2. Its a K-probe temperature controller, but also so much more. If you cook with charcoal on a Weber, Green Egg, Masterbuilt, etc., ditch the crappy built in controller and buy one of these. This thing provides PWM control to your grills fan to stoke the flames and evenly soak the heat. You set a target temperature on device or in-app and just walk awayyour grill will hold that exact temperature basically forever. If you understand what this does, you understand why you need one. And if you dont understand, thank your wallet for your ignorance. VU meters are mankinds greatest inventionwatching boucing needles is a delight and the VU1 from PC casemaker Streacom taps into that analog nostalgia. These are serial-addressable VU meters that have E-Ink displaysjust like a Kindle. Plug them into your PC, install the local server app to your computer, and open your web browser to the configuration web portal. Here is where things start to, uh, fall apart. You see, Streacom didnt want to make an app for thesethey wanted to open source the software in hopes that third-parties would develop integrations for these dials. That uh, didnt happen. These have been out since January and there are but single-digit post numbers on their community forums. If youre smarter than me, you may love the idea of a network addressable VU meter, but if youre equal to or dumber than me in intelligence, hi. What can *we* do with them? Well, their demo app currently allows you to show system info using LibreHardwareMonitor libraries. So CPU and GPU load and temperatures, network usage, power draw, clock speeds, stuff like that. Theyre not cheap, but theyre also not that outrageously priced considering theyre built incredibly well using extruded aluminum and the $140 starter kit comes with 4 dials. Its a cute, minimalist way to spruce up your PC setupthey work really wellif only they had a real community to develop more integrations. And for macOS too! And thats all from me. Are you a smarty pants that already knew about all these gadgets? I doubt it. Let me know what your favorite was in a comment down below, but most importantly, and as always, stay snazzy.",
