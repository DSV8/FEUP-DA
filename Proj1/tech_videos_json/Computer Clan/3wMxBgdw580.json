    "transcript": "- The G4 Cube. It's so cool. Steve Jobs loved making cubes. The NeXT cube, the G4 Cube. I made my head a cube. I like Mark Cuban. Cubes are great. Oh, Apple suspended this product after only one year. We gotta talk about that. Sponsored by Linode. Cloud computing from Akamai. (upbeat music) Hey, everyone. How are you all doing? If you're new here, welcome. My name is Crazy Ken, and I think the G4 Cube is one of Apple's most iconic designs. Heck, even the Simpsons parodied it, so you know it's good. And when MetalJesusRocks says to make a new episode about the G4 Cube, guess what? I'm gonna make a new episode about the G4 Cube. But the big question is why did this computer die so young? And the other mystery is why was it suspended indefinitely and not actually discontinued? So let's time travel. Before we learn how the cube died, we must learn how it was born. It's often speculated the G4 Cube's design was derived from NeXT. Steve Jobs left Apple in 1985 after many conflicting issues with the board and he founded NeXT in September 1985. In October 1988, NeXT released the NeXT Computer which was later named NeXTcube in a 1990 update. And this cube shape is likely the core inspiration for what would eventually become the Power Mac G4 Cube 12 years later. When Apple acquired NeXT in 1997, they didn't just get all of that company's technology, but they got Steve Jobs and his love of cubes. So that's likely where the G4 Cube got its design from. But what happened next? Apple was working hard to miniaturize the architecture of their Power Mac minitower into a small cube form factor. During an interview at Apple's Infinite Loop campus, Steven Levy asked Jobs about NeXT's cube-shaped machines. Jobs replied, \"Yes, we did one before.\" Cubes are very efficient spaces, but Jobs mentioned the key difference with the G4 Cube is it was suspended above the desk unlike the NeXT cube. He actually called it a brain in a beaker. But the design wasn't always this pretty. Products go through multiple testing stages. An early engineering validation test unit or EVT unit shows a tall metal housing, vastly different from the crystal looking design, but in the EVT stage, testers are primarily concerned with testing a minimum viable product. Not all the details are worked out yet, but now we get to the DVT units, design validation testing units. These show a similar design to the final product as Apple dials in the details and gets ready for mass production. I am blessed to own one of these prototype shells. It's pretty similar to the final version, but there's some subtle differences like on the back. Instead of saying Power Mac G4 Cube with the Apple logo, the word prototype is silkscreened. And there's a warning that says this product hasn't been approved by the FCC just to let people know, \"Hey, you can't sell this yet. It needs to go through approval.\" In this stage, Apple was working on a thick curvy acrylic that gave the cube its Feng Shui. Jobs disclosed to Levy it took six months to formulate the plastics and Apple wasn't using traditional molding methods to make this case. They machined the plastic. The screw holes and vent hole were precision machined on the Cube's case. This obsessive attention to detail might seem like overkill, but it worked for the original iMac when Apple poured extra R&D into the case's design, so maybe that would work for the cube too. But then Steve Jobs received some news about the project. Ken Segal was a creative director at Chiat/Day, the ad agency that helped Apple build the \"Think Different\" campaign. Ken and his associates hosted regular agency meetings with Steve and shortly before their next meet, an unnamed person informed Steve that Apple wasn't able to get the Cube's price low enough. In Ken's book, \"Insanely Simple,\" he recalls that Steve was visibly shaken by this news, and rightfully so. Steve really loved this product and he wanted it to succeed. But Apple sells expensive stuff back then and now, so maybe this wouldn't be any different. There's only one way to find out. Let's launch the product. At Macworld 2000 in New York, Steve Jobs introduced new iMacs, updated Power Mac G4s and more. This was all part of the mission critical two by two product strategy that helped save Apple in 1998. But then in traditional Steve Jobs fashion, he announces. - But there's one more thing. - For the first time, Steve expanded that crucial product strategy. So what was gonna go in the blank square? - It is a new desktop machine. - Steve said they were gonna take the horsepower of the Power Mac G4 and combine it with the silence and the elegance of the iMac, all in a brand new eight inch cube. Oh, and it's fanless so it runs quiet. Oh, that's pretty cool, man. You've piqued my interest. Especially in 2000, a lot of computers were big and they kinda just made a lot of noise. - And we call this new product the Power Mac G4 Cube or more affectionately the G4 Cube. - Okay, Steve, you sold me. This sounds like an amazing computer. So let's take a closer look at it. The eight inch G4 Cube was suspended in a especially formulated acrylic we talked about earlier which was very thick and crystal clear and it refracted light beautifully around the edge. - [Man Off-Camera] You know that plastic caused a lot of problems, right? - No, no, we're not there yet. Let's just enjoy this magical thing for the moment. - [Man Off-Camera] But you will talk about how it cracked. - Shut up! The design was very clean with practically no visual distractions, which was a goal of Apple's because this computer was made to sit on your desk, constantly in your eyesight. So where's all the I/O? Where do you plug stuff in? It was all on the bottom. The Cube was equipped with 100 meg Ethernet, a 56K modem port, FireWire 400, USB, VGA for a monitor, and a new type of monitor connection called ADC, Apple Display Connector which we'll talk about more in a minute. Okay, personally, I like a lot of stuff about the Cube, but I never liked the fact that you had to like plug stuff into the bottom of it. I always thought that was kind of annoying, but hey, thankfully Apple doesn't make that kind of stuff anymore. Oh yeah. Now, the Cube was very beautiful, but it was also functional. Back in the day, Apple actually let you open up their computers. It was a great time. All you had to do was push down this handle and it would come up and then you would lift the computer out of... And then you would lift the computer out of... Well, this unit's a little bit old and stubborn so we'll just bust out the butter knife. Do a little jiggle-there we go. And now we can extract. It's normally not this difficult. Now we can extract what Apple calls the Core out of the computer and you could access all the components. Pretty sweet. Let's pop this back in before I break anything. It was important that Apple made the Cube easy to open because on their minitowers, you could do pretty much the same thing. Wow, it was so easy to open these things back then. Anyway, this is where we can see the cooling magic. Again, the Cube had no fan. Steve Jobs hated fans. At the center of all these components was a large vent with a massive heat sink. So the heat from the electronics radiated through the fins and into the air, keeping everything cool without a fan. There's also a heat sink attached to the hard drive and the entire bottom case has ventilation holes and there's an additional vent above the video card. Kinda sounds like what Apple tried with the 2013 Mac Pro where all the components wrapped around a quote unified thermal core. - Can't innovate anymore, my ass. - Now, one of my favorite aspects of this design or pretty much any design is when an engineer puts a little surprise in it. Where's the DVD drive? I'll tell you what, it's right here. That's just so much fun. It's so demonstrable too even 23 years later. And there was no physical power button. Steve Jobs told Levy he didn't wanna put a hole in this design for the button. So the button is touch sensitive with an LED which provides a subtle glow effect. But Ken, this thing is so small. Where's the power supply? Well, that's a neat little trick. If you look really closely, you'll see that the power supply is a giant 205 watt external brick. But don't worry about that, you can just put it under your desk. Now, Apple didn't just stop at the Cube itself. They made all new peripherals to go with. Also announced during the Macworld event was an all new Apple Pro Keyboard with a clear case and eject and volume buttons. Also a brand new Pro Mouse with a matching design. It was completely optical, so no more sticking which we take for granted nowadays. But back in the day before optical mice, we had to wash our balls a lot. But more exciting is Apple's new displays, a 17-inch studio display CRT, a 15-inch LCD studio display, and a massive 22-inch cinema display. The fun thing about these displays is they were all driven by a single cable. You didn't have to plug video and power and all this stuff in separately. That single port drives video, USB data, and power. And this was likely another feature borrowed from Jobs' NeXT days because the NeXT MegaPixel Display also used a single cable. And if you wanted to use these displays with a non-ADC equipped computer, you can buy some Apple conversion technology to make it happen. On April 29th, 2002, Apple introduced the DVI to ADC Adapter. Eons ago, I used this adapter with my Studio Display and a 2009 MacBook Pro in my old lair, aka a closet. Another neat feature was how easy it was to adjust the tilt. You could just push back or pull forward and the stand would automatically move and hold its place just with friction. Physics. So the Cube had some beautiful display options for your content, but what about sound? Oh boy. This is a phone rabbit hole. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe every single Mac Apple has ever sold had a built-in speaker except for the Cube. Why? Well, that's because Apple collaborated with Harman Kardon to make these beautiful spherical... - Spherical! - USB speakers. They sound pretty good for their size. So because they sounded so good, there's no way Apple could have packed this quality into such a small form factor. And another benefit, since they were external, you could put them wherever you'd like. Now, there was no headphone jack on the Cube, but on the USB speaker amp, there was a headphone jack right there. However, I'm gonna tell you a little secret. At one time, Apple was testing a built-in speaker on the Cube. A few years ago, I visited my buddy Hap who has a massive Apple prototype collection. He has a prototype G4 Cube and there's a tiny built-in speaker that's slightly visible through the bottom vents. I can't say with 100% certainty why Apple removed the speaker from the Cube itself, but if I had to guess, they just wanted you to use the sexy HK speakers because they're really good. So why settle for a built-in speaker? Now, normally I'd love to crank these babies to 11 and just blast some tunes. But unfortunately, there was a common defect with these speakers. The surround just disintegrated. And I don't wanna push these things too far especially because they're not mine. They're Michael MJD's. Thanks for the loaners. I actually used to have a pair a long time ago and it suffered a similar fate. So now let's crunch some numbers and geek out with the specs. The Power Mac G4 Cube uses a 450 megahertz PowerPC G4 with Velocity Engine which was critical for speeding up data-intensive applications. For example, compressing video files. It was equipped with 20 gigabytes of hard drive storage stock, a DVD ROM drive, and an ATI Rage 128 PRO graphics card with 16 megabytes of memory. Oh, cool your jets, Apple. No one's gonna need 16 megs of video memory. Speaking of memory, the Cube came with 64 megabytes of PC 100 SD RAM standard. But with the three DIMM slots, you could install up to 1.5 gigabytes. And earlier I mentioned the modem and Ethernet ports, but the Cube also had an optional AirPort card for wireless networking, and the antennas were on the sides of the computer under these circles. And all of this, plus the keyboard, the mouse, the orb speakers could be yours for... $1,799. Okay, I mean, it's an Apple product, so it's going to be a bit expensive. Back then, they sold other expensive products. Today they still sell expensive products, so that might not be a problem. Next month, the Cube went on sale. All right, come on. This is the moment of truth. You can do it. I believe in you Cube. [Duck Quack] Oh, nevermind. Yeah, so total unit sales were only 150,000 which was about a third of what Apple projected. In a 2017 Oxford Talk, Tim Cook admitted that Apple withdrew the Cube within three months, assuming he meant three months after the launch date. I was surprised the Cube actually died way faster than I thought, at least internally. But Apple pressed on a little bit longer because they probably had a bunch of leftover inventory from the low sales, so they had to move that stuff, so they tried a couple tricks. In October, Apple offered $300 back on a Power Mac G4 Cube with a mail-in rebate. If you bundled it with an Apple Display. The offer was invalid at the end of the year 2000. And a little bit later, Apple cut the price down to $1,299 in February, $500 less than the initial price. So now, two big questions remain. Why did the G4 Cube fail, especially so quickly? Like, that was really fast compared to other Apple products. And the other mystery is why was it suspended indefinitely and not actually discontinued? Let's tackle the failure one first. There were a couple small reasons why it likely failed and there was also one really big reason. For starters, the case cracked, kind of a shame because Apple puts so much work into formulating and machining the plastics. Some other people argued the crack issue was blown out of proportion, saying it's a surface flaw. And Apple's Phil Schiller claimed the alleged cracks were seams from the injection molding process. I can understand that argument when I look at the edges of the Cube where you can see a clean seam. But as for these other quote unquote seams, I'll say the jury is out on that one. Users also reported the power button was accidentally triggered by nearby movement. I can't recreate that issue with my Cube, So maybe it was only defective in some units and Apple changed back to regular power buttons for future Macs, so it must have been a real issue. But all of those issues were minor compared to the big problem. Remember the crucial product strategy I mentioned earlier? It was proven to be effective and it was saving Apple, but they deviated from it and tried to expand it by putting a product in the middle which didn't serve either end of the matrix very well. At the time, Apple's consumer-oriented baseline iMac was only $799. So it is extremely unlikely a consumer is willing to shell out $1,000 more for the Cube which didn't even have a monitor. The iMac did. But what about professional users? They're willing to spend more money, right? Yeah, in many cases they are. But Apple had another product that offered way more value than the Cube, the G4 minitower. For $200 less than the Cube, you could purchase a Power Mac G4 with similar specs. Technically, the CPU clock was 50 megahertz less, but you got gigabit Ethernet, three additional hard drive bays, and three PCI expansion slots. True, you miss out on the miniaturization, the fanless design and the cool speakers, but you save $200 and get much more expansion. So that's the route professionals took. Plus on the higher end, the G4 mini towers offered dual processors which was not an option with the G4 Cube. On July 3rd, 2001, Apple officially put the Power Mac G4 Cube on ice, saying they might reintroduce it later. And Apple's VP of Worldwide Product Marketing Phil Schiller said, \"Most customers decided to buy our powerful Power Mac G4 minitowers instead.\" But life's a learning experience and Steve Jobs and Apple learned very quickly they needed to move on and kill the Cube. That's why it died so fast. During that Oxford Talk, Tim Cook debunked the failure is never final expression. And he used the G4 Cube as an example. - You have to recognize when something that you're working on is pushing on a wall. We shipped a product called the Cube. It was a spectacular failure commercially, from the first day almost. And so we had to look at ourselves in the mirror and say, \"We missed this one.\" - But there was some good news that came out of the Cube. For starters, we got a huge cube-shaped Apple Store. Not sure if that's related to the G4 Cube, but it's still cool. Anyway, despite the failure, the Cube's miniaturization achievements were critical to creating the Sunflower iMac G4 introduced in January 2002 with that new flat display and all of those juicy components confined into a small base. In January 2005, Apple introduced the Mac mini with a BYODKM philosophy, bring your own display, keyboard, and mouse. And this time, Apple gauged the market correctly. Instead of making a mini desktop with a hefty price tag, Apple sold the Mac mini for only $499. And it was a huge hit with consumers because Apple still sells and updates the Mac mini today. And in March 2022, Apple introduced the Mac Studio, a taller Mac mini designed with tons of horsepower in a small package. So these two Macs solved the suspended indefinitely and reintroduction mysteries. Although Apple never explicitly said the Mac mini and the Mac Studio are new versions of the Cube, I think it's fair to say that they are spiritual successors. And you want one more nugget? The name of the display Apple introduced with the Mac Studio shares the same name as some of the displays introduced with the G4 Cube, Studio Display. Come on, Apple. That's definitely a nod to the past. You know, the Cube could work as a luxurious headless computer, or maybe even a server, or you could also just use Linode.
