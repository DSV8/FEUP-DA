    "transcript": "(techno music) - Hey guy's how you all doin'? Really, that's just great. You know, I'm doin' pretty great today too because you and I are going to time travel. You know, of all of the history videos people could make, I don't think the history of the Mac OS calculator ever appeared on anybodies list, until today. If you thought a story behind a calculator couldn't be interesting well you're probably right. For the most part, the Mac OS calculator stayed the same for many years, but let's revisit that topic soon. First, let's look at the conception of the first Mac OS calculator, which was released in 1984. Chris Espinosa, who started working at Apple at just 14 years old, found himself on the Mac team in 1981. He was working on documentation for the Macintosh especially for the quick draw graphics. So, to understand it better, Chris wanted to write a demo program. Mr. Jobs, Chris said, I want to write a calculator program. [AWKWARD SILENCE] Cool. When the first demo was ready, he showed it to Steve Jobs. Long story short, Steve didn't like it. The feedback went back and forth until Chris had an idea. Chris modified the program so the calculator's appearance could be changed by pulldown menus. He called it, the Steve Jobs roll your own calculator construction set. Patent pending. Steve sat down and fiddled with the user interface settings for about ten minutes and when he was done, he was happy with it. The plan was to run the calculator as a desk accessory inside of the Macintosh system. Side note, desk accessories were small programs which could run alongside host program. Since the Macintosh could only run one host program at a time, the desk accessories offered a little bit of multi tasking capability on top of that. So, with the design in place, Andy Hertzfeld did the implementation into the system and Donn Denman did all the mathematical semantic stuff. But that was just the first version of the calculator. What changed throughout the years? Let's take a look. Within a short timeframe after the initial release the calculator received a small tweak. Honestly, I didn't even notice the tweak until I did the research for this episode. Some buttons got rearranged. The exponent of ten button got removed. And for some reason there's two equals buttons now. Not really sure why, never found out. Anyway, moving on. The calculator remained the same for multiple system releases. But, in System 7, although the calculator was still labeled as a desk accessory, it ran like a typical application program thanks to the cooperative multitasking in the new OS. Visually, the texture looked a little different and I've seen some screenshots of it in different colors. But I couldn't figure out how to do that myself. Sad face. I couldn't find any design changes or feature changes within OS eight or OS nine. So, for the most part, Steve Job's design from the 1984 calculator remained the same through OS 9. Which received its last update in 2002. It lasted for 18 freakin' years! But then, in Mac OS X 10.0, the calculator was redesigned with the Aqua user interface. But, the features and buttons were the same. In Mac OS two the calculator received the awesome brushed metal treatment, oh yeah. Along with that, it got a paper tape feature. And more advanced operations like factorials. Everybody likes factorials, right? Also, this new update included a handy conversion feature. In Mac OS 10.3 the buttons were redesigned with a gray look and it also featured a floating paper tape window. You could also adjust how many decimal places are displayed and you could display the numbers in different formats such as binary. And in Mac OS X 10.4 something new happened. The calculator was available as a widget inside the Dashboard. New feature in OS X Tiger. In a way, the dashboard widgets were kinda like the desk accessories from the early days of the Macintosh. So that was pretty cool, but the non widget version also received some updates. In addition to the basic and scientific modes it not had a programmer mode. And reverse Polish notation which I just now learned is a thing. Math is pretty cool. In Mac OS 10.5, the Spotlight search feature gained equation support. Truthfully, I type my equations into Spotlight more than into the actual Calculator app. It's pretty handy. Through the next several Mac OS X releases I couldn't find any visual or feature changes with the calculator, aside from small things like the 64-bit update and the Hi-DPI update for the Retina display. But the Mac OS 10.10, the app was completely redesigned along with the rest of the systems user interface. In addition, the Notification Center, which could now support Widgets, gained a calculator function. Thus, concluding the somewhat unnecessary, but still pretty cool history of the Mac OS Calculator. And hey, you had fun and you learned something too, right? Right? So, what do you think? The calculator didn't change for many years. Was that lazy, or was that just because the design was so perfect it didn't need to change? I'm not really sure, but honestly it's just a calculator. It's not super earth shattering, but still pretty cool, right? Hey, if there's any other super niche computer history topics like this that you want me to cover. Do let me know because I'm always curious and I always love to learn new things. Which, I hope you did today too. Thanks for sticking with me. Catch the crazy and pass it on. (techno music)",
