    "transcript": "(Upbeat music) Hey, how's it going? Question for you. How big is your computer? No. I don't mean hard drive capacity. I mean dimensionally. If you're using a desktop it's probably pretty big. But that brings me to what I wanted to talk to you about today. And I'm not alone. I've asked fellow YouTuber Stephen Hackett from 512 Pixels and Druaga1 to help me out. Steve Jobs admired many things about design, but two of them were the cube shape and silent operation, AKA, a computer that cools itself without a fan. Enter, the Power Mac G4 Cube. (Dramatic music) Let's travel back to September 18th, 1990. Steve Jobs was working at NeXt, his other company, and they were just releasing the NeXTcube. A 10 thousand dollar work station computer that had the design of a ... Well, a cube. And a few years after Steve Jobs returned to Apple, this little bad boy was introduced at Macworld New York 2000, and I think it's fair to say that the whole NeXTcube design was kind of the roots of the DNA for this machine, and when Steve Jobs showed this off, people initially were quite stunned with how much horse power was in such a small package. But unfortunately - well fortunately for some, the cube only sold for about a year. But the whole DNA of this cube is probably still alive today in the Mac Mini, which Apple still sells. Well, kind of. It hasn't been updated in about four years, but Apple still sells the Mac Mini. And another historic feature of this cube that kind of lives today still, is the easy open design, and I think that is kind of the root of the shell that comes off the Mac Pro, but we'll talk about more of that design stuff in a minute. The weird thing is that when the Cube stopped selling, it wasn't discontinued, it was suspended indefinitely according to Apple's website. Suspended indefinitely. Hmm. So does that mean maybe the Cube could come back one day? It's something to think about. But for now, let's stay in the past and take a closer look at this Mac. Now, the cool thing about this design was that it had the horse power of a full size Power Mac G4 desktop but in an 8-inch cube. All that performance was squeezed into such a small design, and that 8-inch cube was suspended in this beautiful crystal clear enclosure. And on a desk it just looked freaken beautiful. Heck, nowadays it still looks beautiful. Not just in 2000, but today. So the design was pretty cool looking in my book. This particular G4 Cube is equipped with a 450 megahertz power PC G4 processor, and a gigabyte of RAM. On the graphic side, it featured a Rage 128 Pro video card. So in our last episode of Vintage Apple Vault, we talked about the iBook G3 Clamshell and how it introduced the AirPort wireless networking. Well, this G4 Cube actually featured an AirPort card as well, and on the sides, there's little circles. That's actually where the wireless antennae are so it does work with wifi. So in terms of IO, this computer had ethernet on it, FireWire 400, 12 Mbps USB, Apple display connector, VGA, and a 56K modem. -(Druaga1) This is the power connector. That's right, it has an external supply. Not quite as fancy as the Mac Pro. Oh yeah, and about that supply, it's massive. - So the Apple Display Connector or ADC port, that was actually kinda cool because it was kind of an all in one solution. Video, power and USB all traveled over a single connection. So if you plugged in a monitor, say an Apple Studio Display for example, everything would just run on one cable. Video, USB and power, and you would just plug it right into the G4 Cube. I would stand it up but unfortunately ... (chuckles) my leg broke. So break a leg? No don't say that. Note that there is no headphone port, even though this was a much older computer when headphone jacks were still a thing, there actually wasn't one on this particular machine. Nor was there a built in speaker, which is very unusual because most Macs have a built in speaker. This one was an exception. However, you could get these really cool Pro speakers ... These really cool Pro speakers that go with the computer, and they're made by Harman Kardon, they're really like clear and crystal looking, and they sound pretty good. Mine are kinda getting a little wilted, but they actually work really well. A killer feature of this design was it had no fan. This whole thing doesn't have a single fan inside of it even though it's really small. There's like a core inside here where the air just travels through the center and it's hollow, but there's no fan. Steve Jobs was very particular about making a computer as quiet as possible so this thing was built with no fan. - (Druaga1) And it does bare repeating but that is a pretty massive heat sync and kinda needs it. PowerPC processors get pretty hot. - So here's a cool thing about this computer. The slot loading disc drive. You might not even see it but it is kind of hidden up here. It's kind of like a toaster. Take the disc, drop it in, and it just goes in like that. Aesthetically, that was kinda cool. Another unique part of the design was it had no physical power button. The power symbol on top actually had a little bit of a touch sensor on it so when you touched it, a light would light up underneath it, but it didn't physically retract on a spring or anything like a button or switch. It was a touch sensitive power button basically. - (Druaga1) There's the cool button by the way. Who knows how that works. - And the last thing I wanna share with you guys, I saved the best for last, trust me. You could flip the computer over, and there is this little handle that you could pull out at the bottom. And you could literally lift the internal components right out of the case for easy access to everything on the inside. - (Druaga1) I have much appreciation for Apple in that they made it so - it's easy to get inside. And by easy, I mean easy. Not many Macs are easy to get into. - And you literally lift all of the technology out. (clapping) - Yeah, that one kind of blew the audience's mind away when it was introduced at the Keynote. Do you wanna see more Cube? I know you do. Stick around because I collaborated with Stephen Hackett from 512 Pixels and Drauga1. Stephen has a NeXTcube that he's gonna share with you guys and Druaga1 has a G4 Cube as well, and he's gonna share some stuff with you guys. So stick around for that, and then after, we're gonna be showing the audience photo submissions for Show off Your Setup. Plus at the end of today's episode, we got some funny bloopers for you guys. So stick around, let's take a look at the collectors. - (Druaga1) Hey Smokers, Druaga1 here, and today we're gonna be taking a look at my G4 Cube. For those who don't know me, I've been doing videos on YouTube for a little over 10 years. But only in the past four have I done anything specifically dedicated to computers. Most of the time I'm trying to install things on things that really shouldn't work, but they end up working anyway, or at least sometimes. I'm pretty well known for my tendency to install SSD's in as many things as I can. So other than the G4 Cube, I have a bunch of other things in my collection, but some of the more prominent things that I consider more of say, 'prized possessions' are the following ... An old yellowed Apple //e from the 80's. An Apple 2GS with a 4MB memory expansion card. A pristine and non-yellowed Macintosh SE30, which didn't really fit. Now mainly I don't use this computer very much except for shooting videos and demonstrating a few things. It was up and running, it's not running right now. I had Mac last night installed in a SSD that I installed in there. I used it to text out certain games like Doom and Unreal, and stuff like that that was mainly gaming for testing purposes, as a secondary, it sort of works as my Mac OS9 machine, but I haven't had too much need for it lately. Two of my favorite features are right here on the top actually. Surprisingly, it is actually it's fanless design. Pretty much you just let it sit there, there's no fan in it at all. All the heat just radiates up. And the power button, which has literally no profile, it's just touch sensitive, you're just tapping on a piece of plastic there. So pretty cool. Right here you'll notice that something is missing, and that's the hard drive. Don't have one in here right now, but previously, I had a Radeon SSD installed in this thing, and yes it did work, all be it with not too much of a performance improvement over a mechanical hard disk, but it actually did work just so long as I used a SATA IDE adapter because that's what's inside. If you look deep inside there, you can see that that's your IDE connection and what looks like a wireless card making a photobomb there. And the very dead CMOS battery. Here's the other side if you're curious on how the drive's attached to the logic board. If I was into Macs a little earlier in my life, this would probably be one of the computers that I would have begged my parents to get for me. It is one of the more pro-end machines, sorta. It is the Power Mac series after all, and with this kind of design, I would have been all over this way back in the day. In the future, I may be able to get some use out of it. If nothing more than a hand dryer. Just kidding, don't do that. So thanks everybody for taking a look at my G4 cube. - Hi, my name is Stephen Hackett and I'm the host of the 512 Pixels YouTube channel. Today I wanna talk a little bit about the NeXTcube. Now if you're familiar with Apple history at all, you'll know that shortly after the Macintosh's ho-hum launch, the board of Apple actually let go Steve Jobs. They met and voted him out of the company. The guy who co-founded it. The guy who worked on the Lisa and the Macintosh suddenly gone. Now Jobs did not take this lying down. He gathered some engineers, some from Apple, some from other companies, and created a new computer company that he named NeXT. The idea behind NeXT computer was actually pretty simple. Build workstation grade computers, power them with a unique space operating system and sell them to higher education and to researchers. Now unfortunately that plan didn't necessarily work out. The software is the big success story here though. NeXTSTEP would go onto kinda morph into OpenStep, a version of it that would run across multiple hardware platforms, and it was all purchased by Apple in the late 1990's. NeXTSTEP became the underpinnings to OS 10 and through that decision, Apple sprung back to life. The technology is now found running on our iPhones and iPads, on our Apple Watches, on our Apple TV's, even the HomePod runs a variant of software that started at NeXT. That's an unbelievable legacy. Now the other half of NeXT's plan was to sell hardware. Like I said, workstation grade computers. That meant being powered by the Motorola 68040, a processor also used by Apple at the time. You get up to 64MB of RAM, an optional hard drive, and 256 magneto optical drive. Now that technology never took off but it makes these computers a little unusual. Now NeXT sold two form factors of computer. The first waS called the Slab. Sort of a traditional pizza box design a CRT would sit on top of. But the far more interesting one is the NeXTcube. Built with magnesium, this is a one foot black cube that still looks great today. It's like if Darth Vader designed a computer, he would design this. The cube should be an interesting and familiar shape to Apple fans. Of course you have that iconic New York Apple store, but you also have the Power Mac G4 Cube that Apple released in the early 2000's. The idea behind the two computers actually wasn't all that different. You can have all your components easily accessible but in a machine that you wanted out on your desk because it was beautiful. Like I said the hardware side of NeXT never really took off. The cube for instance was $6500 at launch in the late 1980's. That was a ton of money back in the day for a computer who's operating system was basically unknown. After several years, NeXT did upgrade the cube and the slab, but eventually shuddered its hardware division altogether focusing on software. That doesn't mean the NeXTcubes are gone. There's still a few out there. I got mine from someone on Twitter just a few months ago. Mine unfortunately doesn't run, but I have spent time running NeXTSTEP and emulation and it's like running some sort of bizarre OBATA OS 10. I guess in a way, that's exactly what it is. - (Ken) Thank you Druaga and Stephen for showing stuff off, that was great, but guess what? I know you guys watching, you guys have cool stuff you wanna show off too. So let's take a look at the most recent submissions for Show Of Your Setup. And the first Show off Your Setup winner for this episode is Tommy. Thanks for submitting your photo. It has a G4 Cube in it so that's perfect for today. And I see a MacBook Pro but I only see the display of the MacBook Pro and not the actual MacBook Pro itself. What kinda dark sorcery is this? My goodness. And I wanted to get a PC setup in here for this week, so Harry, AKA Pudding submitted his setup. Pudding is actually his username, no joke, that's pretty cool, and I like the whole square kind of square geometric cubicle kinda shape of everything going on here. So yes, a very cubular episode today. Thank you guys for your submissions. So those were the submissions for Show Off Your Setup on this episode on Vintage Apple Vault, but guess what? Feel free to submit more with the link down in the description below because we may show yours in the next episode. So feel free to submit your photos right now. So there you have it. The Power Mac G4 Cube. This Mac definitely landed onto Apple's list of short-lived products, but it remains iconic, and in my opinion, for the cube, it was more form over function. That's what made it so beautiful, that's what made it so iconic. But that's also what contributed to its short life, so what's next for Vintage Apple Vault? Heck, what's next for the computer plan? Well, that brings me to the most important question I've ever asked in my entire YouTube career, are you a diehard computer techie? Do you want more vintage tech videos? More laughs? More parodies? And do you wanna grow this community of techies to rule the world? Yeah you do. Well you can make that difference right now. You literally have the power to keep the lights on.

You sunk my battleship. CUT! Wooh! Throughout the joke even! Come on ... \"From C2 ...\" YAAAH! This is the Apple 2C, yes, two. You put a face on the slate yeah ... - Yes, yes ... - Yeah, I don't think I should be holding these here slate out. Just don't feel right. Good circle take!",
